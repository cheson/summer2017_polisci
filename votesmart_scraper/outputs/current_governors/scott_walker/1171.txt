Governor Scott Walker received the endorsement of the Physicians for Responsible Government today in the upcoming recall election. Physicians for Responsible Government is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting free market forces and limited government as a means toward a healthier society and stronger economy.
"Governor Walker is making Wisconsin safer and healthier," said Dr. Saied Assef, a Green Bay anesthesiologist and president of Physicians for Responsible Government. "This kind of leadership should be rewarded not recalled. We are grateful for his efforts. He has our enthusiastic endorsement in the upcoming recall election."
In response to the endorsement, Governor Walker said:
"We have made great strides for our most vulnerable citizens and Wisconsin's healthcare industry over the last 17 months. By investing $1.2 billion in additional funding for Medicaid, more than any previous administration, and repaying over $200 million in funds raided from the Injured Patients Compensation Fund, we are helping patients and physicians alike. I thank the Physicians for Responsible Government for its endorsement and look forward to working with patients, physicians, and healthcare providers to make healthcare more affordable for all."
