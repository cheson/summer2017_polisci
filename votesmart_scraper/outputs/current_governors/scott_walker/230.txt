Location: Stevens Point, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined several dignitaries today at the groundbreaking ceremony of the new Chemistry Biology Building on the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point campus.
"The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point is a real asset for our state," said Governor Walker. "More UW-Stevens Point graduates completed research doctorates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields in the last ten years than all other UW System schools except for the University of Wisconsin-Madison."
The UW System Board of Regents, UW System officers, and various academic chairs joined Governor Walker to celebrate the expansion.
"We continue to see a growing demand for skilled workers in the science-based industries," added Governor Walker. "Of the total degrees awarded at UW-Stevens Point in 2015, 33 percent were in high-demand Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and health fields. Without a doubt, the new Chemistry Biology Building will place UW-Stevens Point students on the fast track to reaching their academic goals and pursuing their dream careers."
