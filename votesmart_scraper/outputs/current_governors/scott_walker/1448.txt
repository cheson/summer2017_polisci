Today Governor Walker released the bill draft of his special session bill to overhaul Wisconsin's regulatory process.
"We need to ensure that state agencies are focused on job creation," said Governor Scott Walker. "The proposed review process will make sure only the most necessary rules are implemented so businesses are no longer held back by the costs of overregulation."
This regulatory reform contains a number of provisions including:
* Agencies may not create rules more restrictive than the regulatory standards or thresholds provided by the Legislature
* Agencies cannot create rules based on the agency's general powers or duties
* Rules can be challenged in the county circuit court where the plaintiff resides
* The Governor must approve proposed rules
* Require an economic cost/benefit analysis of rules
* Changing wind energy citing standards
* Targeted wetland regulatory reform
The Wisconsin is Open for Business Special session was called by Governor Walker the day he was inaugurated. All legislation proposed has been aimed at ensuring Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs.
In addition to the regulatory process overhaul, other special session bills include eliminating the state tax on health savings accounts, reforming the Department of Commerce, ensuring Wisconsin has a job friendly legal environment, tax cuts for small businesses located in Wisconsin, tax incentives for businesses to relocate to Wisconsin, expansion of the economic development tax credit, and requirement that a supermajority vote in the Legislature is needed to pass a tax increase.
