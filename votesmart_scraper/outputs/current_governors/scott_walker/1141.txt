The fourth quarter jobs numbers published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) this week show Wisconsin is heading in the right direction. According to the federally published BLS data that is formally known as the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), in 2011 Wisconsin added nearly 20,000 jobs. The QCEW data also shows, among states, Wisconsin gained the 6th most manufacturing jobs in 2011 (11,346).
The media reports various jobs numbers reports and some are more accurate than others, so it's important to point out that the QCEW is considered the single most accurate series available of actual job counts, as it is based on data submitted by more than 96 percent of Wisconsin employers.
The job growth is a good start, considering the state lost more than 100,000 jobs in the three years before I took office, but there is much more work to be done. Getting our fiscal house in order on the state level paved the way. Every day that we get news of a company investing, expanding and growing jobs in the state, is one more step toward a greater future for everyone.
