Private equity firms invested $9.1 billion in Wisconsin in 2012. This placed Wisconsin 14th nationally, according to a Private Equity Growth Capital Council report. Wisconsin broke into the top 20 for the first time in the three years since the report has been published.
"Confidence in Wisconsin's economy has grown and this is yet another positive sign for the future of our state," Governor Scott Walker said. "Our long-term structural reforms, sound fiscal management, and improved business climate are working for Wisconsin. We're heading in the right direction."
Governor Walker set aside $25 million in the state budget for the creation of an investment capital program. The Assembly and Senate recently passed Assembly Bill 181, which creates an investment capital program in Wisconsin. Governor Walker signed the budget into law on June 30 and is expected to sign Assembly Bill 181 into law soon.
Other positive economic indicators for Wisconsin:
- Under Governor Walker, Wisconsin has seen the best two-year job gains under any administration in over a decade.
- Wisconsin's initial unemployment insurance claims are at pre-recession levels.
- Wisconsin was recently ranked 5th in the nation in manufacturing job creation by the National Association of Manufacturers.
- Wisconsin's percent change in average weekly wage in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 12th in the nation; behind only Minnesota in the Midwest.
According to the Private Equity Growth Capital Council press release, "Private equity fortifies and expands businesses, develops new products and innovations and creates jobs for Americans."
