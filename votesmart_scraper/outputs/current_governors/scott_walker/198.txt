Hi, Scott Walker here.
This upcoming Monday is Memorial Day, a day spent with family and loved ones outside grilling and enjoying the beautiful Wisconsin outdoors.
While Memorial Day marks the beginning of summer, it's important we remember the true meaning of this holiday.
Every single day in the United States, brave men and women make the decision to serve and protect our country by joining the Armed Forces. On Memorial Day, we commemorate those who paid the ultimate price for our safety by laying down their lives.
May God bless those who died while defending our country and safeguarding our freedom in the United States Armed Forces -- their dedication, courage, and honor will never be forgotten.
We also thank the active members of our Armed Forces. We pray for their safe return, and we continue our work here in Wisconsin to ensure that when they return home from their service they have the resources that they need to pursue the American Dream.
