Governor Scott Walker today visited the University of Wisconsin-Stout as a part of his Working for Wisconsin Tour. This tour is an opportunity for Governor Walker to travel throughout the state to highlight initiatives and programs that are working for the people of Wisconsin. The visit to UW-Stout focuses on their efforts to prepare the next generation of Wisconsin's workers.
"Learning in this environment helps give students real-world experience in manufacturing, and provides a leg-up as they prepare to enter the workforce," Governor Walker said. "The kind of hands-on experience students at UW-Stout will receive in the FAB Lab is important to the future of Wisconsin. The budget we put in place this year shows our commitment to equipping Wisconsinites with the skills they need to find good-paying, family-supporting jobs in our modern workforce by investing millions in worker training and workforce development programs."
