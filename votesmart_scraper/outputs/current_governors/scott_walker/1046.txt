Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered the weekly radio address titled "Improving Our Jobs Climate."
Transcript below:
Hi. I'm Scott Walker.
My number one priority is helping the people of Wisconsin create more jobs. With that in mind, I signed two very important bills into law this week that will improve our jobs climate.
One helps streamline the process for safe and environmentally sound mining in Wisconsin. Northstar Economics predicts some 3,000 jobs related to the construction of the mine and 2,800 long-term jobs. Both business and labor union leaders joined me at the signings across the state.
The other bill didn't get as much attention but it's just as important. It invests $20 million into workforce development training and the creation of a new system to track workforce needs which will be a tremendous help to our technical colleges and other programs. Employers frequently mention that they have jobs but not enough skilled workers. This new law will help more people get the skills needed to fill those jobs.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute brief radio address once a week.
