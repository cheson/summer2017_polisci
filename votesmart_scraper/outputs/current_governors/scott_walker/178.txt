Location: Waukesha, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined law enforcement officials, community members, and Special Olympics athletes today at the 30th Annual Law Enforcement Torch Run.
"Our Special Olympics athletes demonstrate every day that there is no limit to the human spirit," Governor Walker said. "This event is very close to my heart, and it has been my honor to join individuals from throughout the state for 14 years in kicking off the Special Olympics with the Law Enforcement Torch Run."
The Law Enforcement Torch Run began in 1981 as a means to raise funds and awareness for the Special Olympics and educate the community about the gifts, talents, and abilities of people with intellectual disabilities. In Wisconsin alone, the Law Enforcement Torch Run has raised more than $30 million since 1986. Every year, nearly 1,000 volunteers representing 170 state law enforcement agencies throughout the state participate in the event.
For the annual relay, law enforcement officers are partnered with Special Olympics athletes as they run the "Flame of Hope" to kick-off points throughout Wisconsin, ending in Stevens Point for the commencement of the Special Olympics Wisconsin State Summer Games.
The 2016 State Summer Games in Stevens Point runs from June 9 -- June 11 and nearly 1,500 athletes are expected to compete.
