Hi, Scott Walker here.
Everyone who wants a job can find a job. That's what I said when I ran for election the last time.
Now, there are more people employed in Wisconsin than ever before. And the unemployment rate? Well, it's the lowest it's been since before 9/11. And the percentage of people working? Well, it's one of the best in the nation.
Now, more than ever, we need more people in the workforce.
Our program called Wisconsin Works for Everyone is about helping people transition from government dependence to true independence through the dignity that comes from work. With about 100,000 job openings listed on our state website JobCenterOfWisconsin.com, we have plenty of spots to fill.
Our welfare reforms require adults who are able to work to be employed at least 80 hours a month or at least enrolled in our job training programs for the same amount of time. We're also making sure people can pass a drug test. If they can't, we put them into rehab to get them healthy again so they can eventually enter the workforce.
Now, some criticize our reforms saying we are making it harder to get public assistance. My reaction? No, we're making it easier to get a job.
Our welfare reforms are some of the most aggressive in the country because we need to put people to work. Public assistance should be more like a trampoline and not like a hammock. Wisconsin Works for Everyone does just that. It puts people back on their feet again and into the workforce.
Just like we did when Tommy Thompson was Governor, Wisconsin is leading the nation in welfare reform. Thanks to the members of the state legislature for helping us move these positive reforms forward.
