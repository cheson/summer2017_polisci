Governor Scott Walker released the following statement regarding the Joint Finance Committee's approval of additional funds for public schools and an expansion of the parental choice program:
"When increased state revenues were announced, I called on the legislature to give more money to Wisconsin's public schools, and I am happy to see additional aid included in this budget for public education.
"We have outstanding public, choice, and charter schools in Wisconsin, and our focus should be on the quality of education, regardless of school type, because every child deserves access to a great education.
"This vote by the Joint Finance Committee also gives more parents choices and alternatives to underperforming schools in our state. Because of our tough, but prudent, decisions we are improving the quality of our children's education system, and we're moving Wisconsin forward."
