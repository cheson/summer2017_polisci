Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Wisconsin State Fair."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
The Wisconsin State Fair is one of my favorite events of the year, and there are only a few days left to enjoy it. From the live music to cream puffs and everything in between, the Fair has it all. In addition to over 70 new food items, there's also SpinCity -- the State Fair's amusement park. SpinCity has over 50 great rides including The Super Shot and The Riptide Rollercoaster. I had the chance to go on a few during the Fair's opening day, and it was a blast.
But rides and great food aren't the only thing the State Fair offers. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to participate in the Sweepstakes 4-H Foundation Meat Auction and the Red, White, & Blue Ribbon Auction. These events are always a lot of fun, and they raise a lot of money for youth scholarships and promote great causes like the 4-H and a number of youth development groups.
It doesn't matter whether you come to the State Fair every year or you haven't gone there in the past decade or so. This great Wisconsin tradition wraps up this Sunday, August 11th, so don't miss it. Come on out, have a great time, and celebrate Wisconsin. It's fun for the whole family.
