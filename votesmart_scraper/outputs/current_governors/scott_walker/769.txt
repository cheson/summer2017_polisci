Investing in Wisconsin's Communities: Governor Scott Walker Signs Silver Alert Public Safety Legislation
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 11, 2014
Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 710, which establishes a statewide Silver Alert program. The Silver Alert system notifies the public in case of a missing elderly person, much like the Amber Alert system does in case of a missing child in danger. Governor Walker signed the bill at St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center in Green Bay.
"When an elderly person living with the effects of dementia or Alzheimer's is missing, every minute counts," Governor Walker said. "The Silver Alert system allows law enforcement to get the message out quickly through the media and other resources, so people across the state can help find these missing persons, to bring them home safely."
According to the Alzheimer's Association, Wisconsin has more than 110,000 adults with dementia and approximately 60 percent of elderly affected by dementia will become lost or wander. If these individuals are not found within 24 hours, many will suffer serious injury or death.
Wisconsin joins 41 other states, including Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana, who have Silver Alert-type systems.
Assembly Bill 710 -- Requires law enforcers to use the crime alert network to disseminate reports of missing adults-at-risk. Governor Walker thanked Representatives Ken Skowronski (R-Franklin) and Chad Weininger (R-Green Bay), and Senator Tim Carpenter (D-Milwaukee) for their work on the bill.
It passed unanimously in the Assembly and the Senate; it is Act 264.
