Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 22, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker tonight emphasized the importance of the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit, which was enacted last year.
"We have already heard from companies like Argon Industries in Milwaukee and Gro Alliance in Cuba City, that this tax credit was a factor in their company's decision to grow in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "Tonight, I invite employers in manufacturing and agriculture to learn more about this tax credit and how it can help you reach your business goals."
Argon Industries, in Milwaukee, processes steel, aluminum, fiberglass, and plastics and produces base plates, brackets, frames, and fixtures. Gro Alliance, in Cuba City, is a family owned business, which provides high quality seed and specialty crop production.
More information about the tax credit is available on prosperity.wi.gov or through the Department of Revenue.
