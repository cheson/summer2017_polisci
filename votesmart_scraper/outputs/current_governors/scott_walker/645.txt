Press Release
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker has issued a proclamation kicking off the official start of a year-long celebration of golf in Wisconsin in advance of the 2015 PGA Championship, which will be held August 10-16, 2015, at Whistling Straits in Kohler. The theme of the celebration is "Teeing It Up with the PGA Championship."
"The PGA Championship is a prestigious event that draws the top golfers in the world -- and their fans -- to our great state," Governor Walker said. "We are honored the PGA of America has once again chosen a world-class venue, Whistling Straits, to host this event. We look forward to showcasing all of the wonderful things Wisconsin has to offer."
The PGA Championship perennially features the strongest field and deepest international line-up of any major golf championship, and 2015 will mark the third time the event has been played at Whistling Straits. The course previously hosted the Championship in 2004 and 2010. Additionally, as golf fans prepare to watch Team USA vs. Team Europe in the 2014 Ryder Cup in Scotland this week, it is exciting to note the 2020 Ryder Cup will be played at Whistling Straits as well.
"We've seen such terrific enthusiasm for the 2015 PGA Championship from golf fans across the country and around the world already, but none more so than the wonderful golf fans right here in Wisconsin," said 2015 PGA Championship Director Jason Mengel. "We recently recorded the second-highest one-month total ticket sales in PGA Championship history, which is simply outstanding."
