Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on the Illinois legislature's passage of massive tax increases:
"Wisconsin is open for business. In these challenging economic times while Illinois is raising taxes, we are lowering them. On my first day in office I called a special session of the legislature, not in order to raise taxes, but to open Wisconsin for business. Already the legislature is taking up bills to provide tax relief to small businesses, to create a job-friendly legal environment, to lessen the regulations that stifle growth and to expand tax credits for companies that relocate here and grow here. Years ago Wisconsin had a tourism advertising campaign targeted to Illinois with the motto, "Escape to Wisconsin.' Today we renew that call to Illinois businesses, "Escape to Wisconsin.' You are welcome here. Our talented workforce stands ready to help you grow and prosper."
