MacIver Institute published an article today titled "Act 10 Saves Wisconsin Taxpayers More Than $5 Billion Over 5 Years, MacIver Analysis Finds."
"Five years ago today, we introduced the common-sense reforms included in Act 10, which rightly put the power back into the hands of our citizens," Governor Walker said. "Ultimately, this legislation saved taxpayers billions of dollars and turned the $3.6 billion budget deficit we inherited into a budget surplus -- all without raising taxes. In the years since Act 10's introduction, the tools have been utilized by local governments, schools, and taxpayers to realize significant savings."
