Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 18, 2017
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after the state's workforce agency announced Wisconsin's unemployment rate dropped to 3.2 percent in April, down from 3.4 percent in March. This is the lowest our state's unemployment rate has been since February 2000.
"We have worked hard since 2011 to get our state's economy back on track, and today's news is further evidence we are continuing to move Wisconsin forward.
"Our unemployment rate is down from 8.1% when we took office to 3.2% today. This is the lowest it's been since February 2000, and the number of people in our workforce is at an all-time high. Our reforms are working and our future is bright, but there is more work left to do.
"Now is not the time to raise taxes on middle-class families. I call on members of the Legislature to stand with me and provide continued across-the-board tax relief for the hardworking people of our state so our economy can continue to thrive."
