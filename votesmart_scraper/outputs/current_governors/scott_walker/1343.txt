In reaction to a lawsuit today challenging the law requiring photo identification to be presented when voting, Governor Walker issued the following statement:
There are more photo ID's currently issued than there are registered voters in Wisconsin.
Requiring photo identification to vote is common sense--we require it to get a library card, cold medicine, and public assistance. I will continue to implement common sense reforms that protect the electoral process and increases citizens' confidence in the results of our elections.
Ensuring the integrity of our elections is one of the core functions of government. Photo ID moves Wisconsin forward.
