Hi, Scott Walker here.
As we start the holiday season, there is another thing that brings people together this time of year: football. With the Badgers playing for the Big Ten championship on Saturday and the Packers sharing the best record in the NFL, it is a great time to be a sports fan in Wisconsin.
Plus, college hoops have just started and UW plays Marquette on Saturday. For that game, I have to be PC. Parentally correct that is, as I have a son at Wisconsin and another son at Marquette.
With all these great games on this weekend, take time to enjoy them with family and friends, and pick your favorite team here in Wisconsin to cheer for.
