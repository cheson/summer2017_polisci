Transcript below:

Hi I'm Scott Walker.
On Tuesday, we had a great Wisconsin cookout at the Executive Residence where about 100 lawmakers from both political parties came together to eat some hot brats and burgers as well as drink some cold Wisconsin beer. This social gathering was a great way to renew old friendships and start new ones with officials from both parties.
My wife, Tonette, came up with the idea for a brat summit to bring folks together and was instrumental in making it a success. Donations of food and beer were made from more than 20 different employers from across the state, which helped make it an authentic Wisconsin get-together.
While Tonette helped organize this great event, I worked the grill to serve all the legislators, their spouses, and their staff. The entire event was a nice way to start to come together to move Wisconsin forward.
Also on Tuesday, a new survey came out that showed that Wisconsin is one of the states expected to grow jobs the fastest during the next quarter. That's really good news.
Sharing some good food and a beer is a great way to come together for an afternoon. Working to help small businesses grow and add jobs will continue that cooperation long after the brats and burgers are gone.
