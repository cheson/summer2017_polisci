Governor Scott Walker signed Act 13 today which helps the State of Wisconsin end Fiscal Year 2011 with a balanced budget.
"This act helps us finish the fiscal year with a balanced budget without raising taxes on the middle-class," Governor Walker said. "The balanced budget bill also allows us to put an additional $176.5 million into healthcare for poor Wisconsinites. I thank the Legislature and members from both parties on its timely passage."
