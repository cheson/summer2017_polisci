Growing the Economy: Governor Scott Walker Announces "Pay Their Way" Plan for Milwaukee Bucks Arena
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today announced a first-of-its-kind "Pay Their Way" plan to grow the economy and protect state taxpayers from the loss of current and future tax revenue generated by the Milwaukee Bucks.
"This solution allows for the state to make an investment in economic development in Milwaukee, while protecting Wisconsin taxpayers from risk," Governor Walker said. "This "Pay Their Way' plan will help to turn a great potential loss in revenue into the potential for great gain."
Under the "Pay Their Way" plan, a Sports and Entertainment District would be created to provide bonding authority to pay back a $220 million grant for a new sports arena. The grant will be in the form of an appropriation bond issuance, paid back by projected growth in income taxes from the Bucks, as well as visiting teams, due to salary increases and new TV contracts. No current base revenues would be used to pay for the bonds, and once the bonds are paid off, the tax growth would return to the state.
Without a new arena, the Bucks would likely leave Wisconsin in 2017, costing the state nearly $10 million per year in income tax collections alone. In addition, if no action is taken on the current Bradley Center, the state is still on the hook for as much as $100 million in maintenance and debt service costs, but without an anchor tenant to drive sales and bring business to the arena and local area.
If the Bucks are sold, the revenue from that sale would first go to pay back these appropriation bonds.
