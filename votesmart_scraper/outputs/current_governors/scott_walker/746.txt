Press Release

Date: May 8, 2014
Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker attended VISIT Milwaukee's annual meeting today and delivered remarks highlighting the increase in tourism and the economic impact on the state and Milwaukee area. VISIT Milwaukee is the convention and visitors bureau for the Milwaukee area; its mission is to market Milwaukee as a destination for conventions, trade shows, and travel.
"Tourism is Wisconsin's welcome mat to the state, and Milwaukee County had a banner year in 2013," Governor Walker said. "The wonderful hospitality at the area's great restaurants and hotels, and the accommodations for conventions and meetings, combined with area attractions including the lakefront, the Harley Davidson Museum, Summerfest, the Wisconsin State Fair, and so much more, are the reason more people are choosing Milwaukee County as a great place to visit."
In 2013, Milwaukee County hosted several significant events including the National Governors Association meeting, Connect Marketplace, and Harley Davidson's 110th Anniversary. Attendance at the Wisconsin State Fair was up almost ten percent to more than one million -- the largest reported attendance since 1969.
