Governor Scott Walker joined students, faculty, and veterans today at Kettle Moraine Lutheran High School in Jackson for their Veterans Day program. The program honoring Wisconsin's veterans featured local veterans, Kettle Moraine alumnus, and current students who have enlisted in the United States military.
"Every day, we are able to enjoy our freedom thanks to the devotion and sacrifice of the brave men and women in our armed forces," Governor Walker said. "Wisconsin's veterans have selflessly dedicated their time, talent, and service to our nation and it is our job to ensure their transition back into our communities is a smooth one. We are committed to helping every veteran who wants to start their own business or find a job to accomplish that goal."
