Today Governor Walker applauded the Legislature for passing Senate Bill 428, bipartisan legislation aimed at streamlining the work done at the Public Service Commission (PSC).
"It's not often that members of both political parties agree to changes to the regulatory duties of any state entity," said Governor Walker. "This bill will allow the PSC to operate more efficiently and effectively. These streamlined processes will allow PSC to provide greater certainty to the businesses they regulate. What this translates into for the average Wisconsin resident is an energy bill that is lower than it would be without this bill. I would like to thank State Senators Zipperer and Holperin and Representatives Klenke and Zepnick for introducing this bill and helping usher it through the legislative process."
According to the PSC, key provisions of the bills include: allowing the PSC to interact with interested parties by email notifications; clarifying the effective date of PSC decisions; raising the threshold for, indexing, and setting timelines for affiliated interest transactions and certificate of authority applications; allowing utilities to conduct customer-requested abandonment and service drops; updating the renewable energy credit administration process; enacting ethics reforms for PSC Commissioners; and creating penalties for the theft of electric power and infrastructure.
