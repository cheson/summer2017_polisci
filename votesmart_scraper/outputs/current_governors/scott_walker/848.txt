STUART VARNEY, GUEST HOST: The president meeting with top CEOs today in a push to get the long-term jobless back to work.
But if he really wants to create more jobs, this guy he just met with yesterday says take a cue from him, Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker calling for a $500 million tax cut in his state.
Governor, welcome to the program.
GOV. SCOTT WALKER, R-WIS.: Good to be with you. Thanks for having me on.
VARNEY: You met with the president yesterday, unlike your Democrat opponent in the gubernatorial races, who wouldn't meet with him.
(LAUGHTER)
VARNEY: You did meet with him.
Did you talk to him about your plan for creating jobs, and, if so, what did he say?
(LAUGHTER)
WALKER: In this case, it's pretty cold in Wisconsin, so we spent a limited amount of time talking outdoors. But it was really talking in our case about the propane crisis in the state.
