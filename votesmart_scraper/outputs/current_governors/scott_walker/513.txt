Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled, "Support for Safe and Healthy Families."
Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
This week, it was an honor to celebrate a great milestone here in Wisconsin. The Sojourner Celebration of Courage event in Milwaukee marked the completion of the private fundraising campaign for the Sojourner Family Peace Center. This first-of-its-kind facility will provide adult and child-focused services to families impacted by domestic violence and child abuse, so they feel safe and protected in every way.
We are providing $10.6 million in state money for the $26 million project, which will include a 56 bed shelter, as well as mental health services, legal clinics, and education centers. This project should be completed later this year.
Thank you to all parties who worked so hard to make this happen -- And focused on, not just how to help those affected by domestic violence, but how to do the best job we can -- so that people can live healthy, happy, safe lives.
