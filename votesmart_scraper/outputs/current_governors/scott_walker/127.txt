Hi, Scott Walker here.
As the parent of a student attending the University of Wisconsin, I know how important it is to keep school affordable for college students and working families. That's why I am proud that we froze tuition at all University of Wisconsin campuses four years in a row. Looking ahead, we will continue the tuition freeze.
We also want our students to receive an outstanding education here in Wisconsin. That's why we are proud that UW-Madison is 11th among public institutions in U.S. News & World Report's latest college rankings - and that the entire UW system is highly regarded around the world.
Our next state budget automatically adds $50 million to the UW system budget. On top of that, I will propose an increase that will be connected to performance metrics, such as the number of graduates and how many graduates actually find work.
Over the past few years, we increased funding for our technical college system, including performance funding, and it's working very well. Now, we can do the same for the UW.
Working together, the next state budget will continue to ensure that college is affordable here in Wisconsin and will help the UW system continue to be one of the very best university systems in the country.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and www.walker.wi.gov/media/weekly-radio-addresses.
