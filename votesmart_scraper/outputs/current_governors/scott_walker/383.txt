Governor Scott Walker Releases Statement on Decision to Stay the EPA's Waters of the United States Rule
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 9, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today relating to the decision by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to issue a nationwide stay of the rule.
Today's ruling is a win for Wisconsin residents and job creators. Throughout this process we have seen yet another example of President Obama's administration exceeding its authority in pursuit of a political agenda that will negatively impact Wisconsin's citizens. We will continue to monitor this case as we work to protect against the uncertainty caused by the federal government's overreach.
