Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 2, 2014
Location: Oshkosh, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 252 today at Schwab Properties, LLC. The bill allows villages or cities to require the Department of Revenue to re-determine the base value of tax incremental financing (TIF) districts.
"Investing in our communities is an important part of ensuring our economy is growing and continuing to move forward," Governor Walker said. "By re-determining the base value, we encourage development and establish accurate TIF districts around the state."
Senate Bill 252 -- TIF districts around the state were hit hard by the recession, and unfortunately, the base value for some of these districts was valued higher than their current value. The Department of Revenue will re-determine the base value if the district is in a "decrement situation," where the current value is at least 10 percent below the base value for two consecutive years. The bill will increase incremental revenue for community redevelopment. Senator Rick Gudex (R-Fond du Lac) and Representative Michael Schraa (R-Oshkosh) authored the bill, which passed the Senate 32-0 and the Assembly concurred on a voice vote; it is Act 183.
Schwab Properties, LLC includes more than 375 residential, campus, and commercial properties in the Oshkosh, Fox Valley area. Owner Dennis Schwab and his family have been involved in the real estate business, including management and development, since 1966.
