Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 21, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed a proclamation renaming Wisconsin Act 267 (Assembly Bill 726) as "Lydia's Law" in honor of 7-year old Lydia Schaeffer of Burlington.
Schaeffer battled a seizure disorder and passed away on Sunday, May 11, 2014, 24 days after Governor Walker signed the bill into law. Act 267 allows the use of Cannabidiol Oil Extract for treatment of seizures. Lydia's parents, Sally and Tom Schaeffer, worked to educate lawmakers and push for passage of the law, which had bipartisan support. The family was present when Governor Walker signed the legislation.
"It was a great pleasure to meet Lydia and see how her smile fills a room with joy," Governor Walker said. "We rename this law in her honor to keep her memory alive, and we pray that all children who are suffering find relief from their pain. Tonette and I send our deepest condolences to the Schaeffer family."
Representative Robb Kahl (D-Monona), Representative Scott Krug (R-Nekoosa), and Senator Robert Wirch (D-Kenosha) authored the bill which passed the Assembly on a voice vote and was concurred by the Senate 33-0.
