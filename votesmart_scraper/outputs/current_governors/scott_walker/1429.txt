Today Governor Walker announced the details of his budget address, which will be held before a joint session of the Legislature at Vita Plus, an employee owned manufacturer of animal livestock feed, supplements and base mixes. The Legislature will convene at 1:30pm on Tuesday February 22nd at the Madison Distribution Center which is located at 3019 Progress Road.
"I am giving my budget address outside of the Capitol to highlight the goal of my administration, ensuring Wisconsin has a business climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs by the end of my first term," said Governor Walker. "This joint session of the Legislature and my speech will highlight the importance of the Wisconsin's hard working, middle class employees and the sacrifices private sector workers and their families have made over the last few years. While the fiscal and economic challenges facing the State of Wisconsin are serious, I am optimistic about our future. My budget proposal makes the tough decisions necessary to move toward the goal of private sector job creation."
Vita Plus mainly serves livestock producers in the Midwestern United States--including its home state of Wisconsin, as well as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and South Dakota--through more than 200 dealers and "on-farm feed manufacturers."
Along with supplying feed products to farmers, Vita Plus considers itself to be a "technology interpreter" by conferring with a wide variety of agricultural experts in the development of its products. These experts include industry leaders, production managers, as well as private and university-based researchers and scientists.
