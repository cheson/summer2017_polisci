Press Release

Governor Scott Walker has asked the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to view flood damage and meet with local and state officials in Vernon County. The information gathered could be used to request the SBA provide federal low-interest loans to homeowners and businesses that suffered damage during last month's flooding.
"I know many homeowners and businesses are still trying to recover from the flash floods that hit the area last month," said Governor Walker. "Damage estimates indicate more than $4 million in damage was sustained to the private sector. We want to make sure we can provide disaster aid to help these families and businesses get back on their feet quickly and requesting an SBA damage assessment is another important step in that process."
Heavy rains caused widespread flooding and mudslides in western Wisconsin September 21 and September 22. Vernon County was hit particularly hard, and local emergency management officials suggest damage assessments show 43 homes were destroyed, 27 sustained major damage, and more than 160 homes suffered minor flood damage. In addition, one business was destroyed, and four others sustained major damage during the flash flooding. Many of the homes and businesses were not covered by insurance.
Under an SBA declaration, SBA offers home and personal property loans, business physical disaster loans, and economic injury disaster loans are offered.
