In honor of Flag Day (June 14), Governor Scott Walker today celebrated the dedication of the world's tallest flag pole today at ACUITY. The massive 400 foot flagpole is eleven feet wide at the base, and is dedicated to veterans who lost their lives in the line of duty. Standing nearly ten stories taller than the Statue of Liberty, it is the tallest flagpole in the world flying a U.S. flag.
"The American flag stands as a symbol of freedom, hope, and democracy," Governor Walker said. "People around the world recognize the American flag as a beacon of light and a sign of freedom. Our flag is proudly flown all across Wisconsin, this great nation, and even on the moon."
