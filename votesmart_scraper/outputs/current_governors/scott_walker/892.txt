Date: Dec. 7, 2013
Location: King, WI

Governor Scott Walker attended a memorial ceremony commemorating the 72nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor today at the Wisconsin Veterans Home in King.
"Americans will never forget the bravery of the men and women defending our country at Pearl Harbor. The attack stands as a constant reminder that freedom is not free," Governor Walker said. "It comes at a high price that the courageous men and women of our Armed Forces continue to bear."
Four Wisconsin natives who survived the attack participated in the ceremony. Governor Walker honored these men individually and all veterans from WWII by proclaiming December 7, 2013 as Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.
An estimated 200 military personnel from Wisconsin were at Pearl Harbor during the time of the assault, and at least 56 paid the ultimate sacrifice. Commander Franklin Van Valkenburgh of the USS Arizona and Commander Cassin Young of the USS Vestal received the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions.
