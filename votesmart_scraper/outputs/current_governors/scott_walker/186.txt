Governor Scott Walker addressed attendees today in Madison at the inaugural United Negro College Fund (UNCF) Wisconsin Governor's Luncheon. Hosted by UNCF, the luncheon conveys the importance of academic assistance programs to corporate sponsors and Wisconsin business leaders.
"To develop the future leaders of Wisconsin, we need to provide them with a quality education today," Governor Walker said. "The United Negro College Fund has a long history of providing hardworking minority students with the means to pursue higher education in Wisconsin. We applaud them for their efforts to create more opportunities for students to attain the education and qualifications required to meet the needs of our employers, which is a vital component as we continue our work to enhance Wisconsin's economy."
The Governor's Luncheon highlights the UNCF's notable contributions towards fulfilling its promise to assist students in achieving their higher education goals, including:
Awarding over 10,000 scholarships annually, at over 1,100 institutions and universities
Raising more than $4.5 billion for under-represented minority students since its founding
Helping over 400,000 students across the country receive college degrees and job training
Founded in 1944, the UNCF is the nation's largest organization providing minority scholarship assistance and awarding scholarships and internships to students from low and moderate income families. Their mission is to build a robust and nationally-recognized pipeline of under-represented students, who, because of UNCF support, become highly-qualified college graduates.
