The Friends of Scott Walker campaign released a new ad today titled "Spending," which highlights Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett's support for $100 million in reckless spending on a boondoggle trolley project in Milwaukee.
"At a time when Milwaukee ranks as America's ninth poorest city and its unemployment rate stands at a shocking 10.4 percent, Mayor Tom Barrett wants to spend $100 million of taxpayer money on a boondoggle trolley project," said Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews. "Mayor Barrett's backwards priorities are out of line with the needs of his city and would take Wisconsin back to the failed days of billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases, and record job loss."
Transcript of "Spending" (:30)
Governor Scott Walker:
Tom Barrett wants to spend more than $100 million on a trolley for Milwaukee.
Now that's the kind of reckless spending that left Wisconsin with more than a $3 billion deficit.
We eliminated that deficit by making government more efficient.
We cut waste and fraud, and our reforms have saved taxpayers more than a billion dollars.
And by reducing taxes, we helped employers create more than 30,000 jobs.
That's how we move Wisconsin forward.
