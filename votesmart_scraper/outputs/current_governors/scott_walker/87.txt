Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Easing the Property Tax Burden for Wisconsin Families."
Hi, Scott Walker here.
Great news for Wisconsin taxpayers! Estimated property tax bills for the typical homeowner this year will be $116 lower than they were in 2010. Over the past six years, the cumulative estimated savings for homeowners is more than $1,700 when compared to the previous four-year trend.
In 2010, the property tax burden, as a proportion of personal income, rose to the highest level our state had seen since the mid-1990s. Today, thankfully, it's the lowest it's been since 1946.
What does that mean for Wisconsin homeowners? Well, it means a few extra dollars that can be tucked away for a rainy day, used for a fun vacation, or reinvested back into our state's economy. And over the years, that money really adds up.
We've taken big steps to lower the property tax burden for Wisconsinites in the past, and we will continue to prioritize ways to ease the tax burden for hard-working Wisconsin families.
Wisconsin property taxpayers needed a champion, and our efforts over the past six years have put you first. Looking forward, we will continue to do just that by holding the line on property taxes in the next state budget.
