Governor Scott Walker will begin his 10-day "Continuing Wisconsin's Comeback" Bus Tour across Wisconsin tomorrow from the Republican Party of Milwaukee County's headquarters in West Allis. Governor Walker will criss-cross the state in the final days of the campaign meeting with voters and sharing his plan for a second term which includes: helping people keep more of their paychecks, helping people learn more to earn more through worker training, and helping move people from government dependence to true independence through work.
"Four years ago, Wisconsin was in rough shape after losing 133,000 jobs and 27,000 businesses," Governor Scott Walker said. "Now four years on, thanks to our reforms and common sense approach, Wisconsin is on a comeback and we are heading in the right direction with more than 110,000 new jobs and the lowest unemployment rate since 2008. I'm excited to cover the state in the next 10 days and share this great story with voters."
