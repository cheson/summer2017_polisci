Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Today the Department of Public Instruction released an outline of Wisconsin's new school accountability system. The release follows the recent approval of Wisconsin's request for flexibility under the federal No Child Left Behind Act.
Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the school accountability system outline:
I was proud to work with Dr. Tony Evers, educators, parents, school officials, local leaders and others to help the Department of Public Instruction develop this new school accountability system outline. I support creating a transparent education system that ultimately evaluates all publicly funded schools in Wisconsin.
This new system will empower parents, allowing them to make education related decisions based on reliable and uniform data. This school accountability data will help us provide assistance to schools that aren't preforming adequately; similarly, it will make it easier to replicate educational successes.
Governor Walker ran for office on a pledge to create a school evaluation system based on objective criteria to help schools improve. The school report cards, developed through a collaborative and bipartisan task force, are designed to provide parents and educators honest information about their schools' performance. The system will help schools improve and learn from one another while also facilitating the replication and expansion of what works.
