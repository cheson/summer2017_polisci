Private sector added over 10,000 jobs; Wisconsin's unemployment rate drops to 7.4%
Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement today regarding the Department of Workforce Development January jobs report:
"The number one goal of my Administration is to get government out of the way so that the private sector can create 250,000 jobs by 2015," Governor Scott Walker said. "Adding over 10,000 private sector jobs in January shows that Wisconsin is on the right track toward fulfilling that important goal. While these numbers are encouraging, there is still important work ahead. Our Special Session on Job Creation coupled with our continuing efforts to improve Wisconsin's business climate sends a strong message to the global marketplace that Wisconsin is Open for Business."
