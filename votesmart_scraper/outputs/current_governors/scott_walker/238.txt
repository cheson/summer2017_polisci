Protecting Wisconsin's Children

Hi, Scott Walker here.
Recently, I signed into law new protections for Wisconsin's most vulnerable -- our children.
Our job is to protect every person in our state, but we have a special responsibility to protect Wisconsin's children.
We enhanced the tools available to law enforcement officers and child welfare agencies so they are better equipped to respond to crimes against our children. This will reduce the risk of Wisconsin's children becoming victims of abuse.
Protecting our children starts with ensuring that they have loving families. That is why I signed four bills into law this week to strengthen Wisconsin's adoption process.
One of those bills provides training courses to potential adoptive parents before they adopt to help them create a safe, nurturing environment for their children.
Strengthening Wisconsin's families is crucial to the success and well-being of our citizens throughout the state. Looking forward, we will continue our work to build a safe Wisconsin where our children and families feel secure and are able to pursue their piece of the American Dream.
