Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 81 into law today at Schneider National, Inc. in Green Bay. Senate Bill 81 relates to the eligibility of hydroelectric resources under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for electric providers.
"Allowing electric providers to use a wider range of renewable energies will make Wisconsin's environment cleaner for future generations," Governor Walker said. "I thank Senator Lasee and Representative Klenke for their leadership on this issue."
Senate Bill 81 expands utility companies' ability to meet the RPS which is effective on December 31, 2015. Under the RPS, an electric utility is required to provide at least two percent more of their electricity from renewable resources in 2011 than in 2010 and at least six percent more in 2015.
The bill expands the definition of hydroelectric facilities that are eligible to count towards compliance with the RPS. The expansion includes hydroelectric facilities that meet the following criteria:
· It has a capacity of 60 megawatts or more (defined as large).
· It was placed in service on or after December 31, 2010.
Making the effective date of the bill December 15, 2015, allows for the construction of new large hydroelectric facilities and gives electric providers the opportunity to meet the standard while pursuing other types of renewable energy.
