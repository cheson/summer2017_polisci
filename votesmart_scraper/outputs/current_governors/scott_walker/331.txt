Hi, Scott Walker here.
This week, we announced our college affordability legislative package, which focuses on making higher education more accessible and more affordable for college students and working families here in Wisconsin
The legislative proposals aim to deduct all student loan interest, increase Wisconsin grants for technical colleges, create grants for students in emergency financial need, increase internship opportunities, and help students and families make informed financial decisions.
These proposals ultimately help the students of our state afford the higher education path that best suits their career goals, whether through a training program, technical college, or four-year program.
With two sons in college, I know how important it is to make sure higher education is affordable for both college students and the working families of our state.
One of the most important things we've already done for higher education in Wisconsin is freeze UW System tuition for four years. When compared to the average increases over the prior ten years across the UW System, students will save an average of $6,311.
The college affordability legislative package will build on our tuition freeze and continue to make higher education even more affordable for Wisconsinites.
