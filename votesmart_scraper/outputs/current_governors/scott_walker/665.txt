Governor Scott Walker Delivers Remarks at Governor's Traffic Safety Conference
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Aug. 27, 2014
Location: Green Bay, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks at the 40th annual Governor's Conference on Traffic Safety. The theme for this year's conference, which brings together state and local officials, industry leaders, and stakeholders, is "Takin' it to the Streets" with the goal of changing the traffic safety culture in Wisconsin.
"Our goal is zero deaths on Wisconsin roads," said Governor Walker. "This event is a great opportunity to bring everyone to the table and continue our work to improve traffic safety in Wisconsin. Together, we can build upon our successful efforts to expand and enhance traffic safety initiatives and work to reduce the number of lives lost on our roads."
In 2013, Wisconsin had the lowest number of traffic fatalities in almost 70 years. Zero in Wisconsin is the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's (WisDOT) campaign to eliminate traffic deaths in Wisconsin. It consists of several law enforcement efforts, as well as public outreach and education programs.
Additionally, the "Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over' initiative will run through September 1st. Almost 400 law enforcement agencies across the state will be out in this annual enforcement against drunk driving. Last year, 185 people died in alcohol-related crashes in Wisconsin.
The conference will host a variety of traffic-safety related workshops and speakers on topics ranging from incident management and child passenger safety, combating impaired driving, and highlighting new traffic control technologies WisDOT is implementing to enhance traffic safety.
