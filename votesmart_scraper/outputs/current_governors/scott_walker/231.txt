Date: May 5, 2016
Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined community and spiritual leaders today at the Italian Conference Center for the Governor's Prayer Breakfast. The breakfast coincides with the National Day of Prayer, which is held annually on the first Thursday of May. The Governor's Prayer Breakfast brings followers of different faiths and denominations together for a morning of prayer and reflection.
"Every year, the National Day of Prayer unites people throughout our nation of different faiths and religions for a day driven by the power of prayer," Governor Walker said. "The Governor's Prayer Breakfast allows us to celebrate our freedom to worship in Wisconsin and pray for peace and justice."
The Wisconsin Governor's Prayer Breakfast was organized more than 40 years ago and honors the National Day of Prayer, which was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman in 1952. The theme for the 2016 National Day of Prayer is "Wake Up America," which emphasizes the need for individuals to return to God in reverence.
Governor Walker also proclaimed today as a Day of Prayer throughout Wisconsin.
