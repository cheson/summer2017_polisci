GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Right now, new and improved job numbers. Will those new numbers convince Wisconsin voters to keep their governor, Governor Scott Walker? Governor Walker faces a recall election in just 19 days, and today Governor Walker releasing new employment figures. They show Wisconsin actually added jobs during his first year in office, 23,000 jobs.
Governor Walker's opponents argue he hurt the state's economy with a law stripping the collective bargaining rights of some public workers. So will the new jobs numbers disarm his political opponents?
Governor Walker joins us. Good evening, sir.
WIS. GOV. SCOTT WALKER: Good evening. Good to be with you, Greta.
VAN SUSTEREN: Nice to see you, sir. All right, these job numbers, you were quick to release them. They technically would be sent to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and be released by the federal government sometime the end of June, but you're getting them out now, obviously, because they show favorable numbers. Are you pleased with the 23,000?
WALKER: Well, absolutely. It is literally a 57,000-plus increase from where my opponents are claiming the numbers were last year. Their numbers were based on a sample poll of about 3.5 percent of employers in this state. They showed a job loss.
Instead, these are actual numbers taken from surveys of over 150,000- plus employers from across the state. That's 96 percent plus of all the employers in Wisconsin. And that shows real data. Those are the real numbers. They show we gained more than 23,000 jobs last year, 33,000 since I've been elected. And that's good news for everyone who cares about Wisconsin's economy because we're moving forward.
