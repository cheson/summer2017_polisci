The "Back to Work Wisconsin" Special Session passed more pro-jobs legislation today to make a positive environment for job creation. Three pro-jobs bills are now headed to Governor Walker's desk for his signature.
"The bills included in this special session are aimed at making it easier for employers to create jobs and I am pleased to see legislation headed to my desk that reforms regulations and makes it easier for small businesses to start-up and grow in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "I thank legislators from both parties for working together in this productive special session."
