Today, Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks at the Wisconsin Commercial Ports Annual Meeting at the Neville Public Museum in Green Bay. Wisconsin is home to 29 commercial ports and throughout the year, these ports handle more than 30 million tons of cargo, generating 10,000 jobs and more than $2.4 billion in economic activity.
"Wisconsin is a premier location with great infrastructure for business, including commercially-navigable waterways on three sides of the state: Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, and the Mississippi River," Governor Walker said. "Our ports play a pivotal role in the transportation of goods throughout the state and nation. This annual meeting is an opportunity for experts and professionals to come together, exchange ideas, and develop strategies that continue to build and support our thriving ports, which are critical to growing our economy."
The Wisconsin Commercial Ports Association (WCPA) was created in 2001, and works to promote and grow transportation by waterway. Membership includes ports, privately operated terminals, port-related service providers, and government agencies.
In addition to attending the Annual Commercial Ports Meeting in Green Bay, Governor Scott Walker has also declared August 18-24 as "Ports Week."
