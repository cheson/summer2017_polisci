Governor Walker Signs Legislation Focusing on Restorative Justice
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 26, 2016
Location: West Bend, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed into law legislation to provide alternatives for certain repeat offenders to get treatment instead of incarceration and additional measures to combat drunk driving at the Old Courthouse Museum in West Bend. Assembly Bill 657 and Assembly Bill 839 are a step forward in reducing recidivism for certain offenders and lower the cost to the criminal justice programs by offering treatment options instead of jail time.
"Dependence on alcohol or drugs is an issue we take very seriously in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "The bills we are signing into law today give those struggling with substance abuse treatment options instead of jail time."
Assembly Bill 657, now Act 388, increases funding for Treatment Alternatives and Diversion programs (TAD), which have been shown to be an effective way to reduce recidivism for certain offenders by creating an alternative to prosecution or incarceration of people who use alcohol or other drugs. The bill was authored by Representative John Nygren (R -- Marinette).
According to a University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute study, for every dollar invested in Treatment Alternatives and Diversion programs, the state saves $1.96 in correction costs.
