Governor Walker Sends Letter to Union Leadership
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 15, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker released a letter he sent to the union bosses who recently criticized the head of MTEA, Bob Peterson.
At the time Act 10 and Act 65 passed, the Milwaukee school district said doing so could save 200 education jobs in the city, but the union said they would choose layoffs over savings. This week the union appeared to change its mind and asked the Governor and the legislature to give them another opportunity to realize the savings offered by Governor Walker. After the Governor and legislature signaled their willingness to help Milwaukee Public Schools, other public sector union bosses sent the Milwaukee teacher's union a letter, telling them to take back their ask of help from the Governor and legislature.
In the union boss letter, the public sector union bosses said, "Such legislation will enable Governor Walker to claim victory of his policy to reign in public employee wages and benefits Allowing Governor Walker to make such a claim just before the recall election will prove detrimental to recalling him"
The letter was signed by the bosses of the Madison teachers union, the Kenosha teachers union, the Green Bay teachers union, and the Racine teachers union.
