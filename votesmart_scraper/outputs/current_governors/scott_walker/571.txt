Location: Milwaukee, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker addressed teachers, administrators, and school board members at the 2015 Wisconsin Education Convention in Milwaukee. The Wisconsin Association of School Boards organized the annual convention.
"In the past four years third grade reading scores rose along with overall graduation rates and Wisconsin now ranks 2nd in the nation in ACT scores," Governor Walker said. "We empowered local schools to keep the best and brightest teachers in their classrooms and the results speak for themselves. I want these trends to continue and am committed to improving the quality of education for all children in Wisconsin."
During his 2015 State of the State Address, Governor Walker called on the Wisconsin Legislature to craft legislation establishing an accountability measure for all schools receiving public funding. This objective measure will provide parents the information they need to decide the best education for their children. Governor Walker also asked the Assembly and Senate to pass legislation removing any requirement that schools adopt and operate the Common Core standards to ensure Wisconsin's high academic standards continue and that these standards are set at the local level.
Founded in 1921, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards and contains members from districts across the state. The Wisconsin Association of School Boards offers its members an array of benefits including leadership training, communication services, and advocates for issues facing public education.
