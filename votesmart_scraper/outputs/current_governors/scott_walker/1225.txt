Location: Madison, WI

Recent survey data that looks at employers, points to a positive economic look for Wisconsin.
"Wisconsin is Open for Business," said Governor Walker. "Employer surveys indicate, overwhelmingly, that Wisconsin's economy is better off than it was just a few years ago. Data projects job growth, economic expansion, and sustained growth. I will remain focused on ensuring businesses are able to hire skilled employees so that we can continue to create jobs in Wisconsin."
On March 13, the Manpower Group, released their Manpower Economic Outlook Survey, and stated:
· Employers in Wisconsin expect to hire at an active pace during the second quarter of 2012;
· Employers' hiring expectations for Quarter 2 2012 are stronger compared to Quarter 1 2012 when the Net Employment Outlook was 8%;
· From April to June, 21% of the companies interviewed plan to hire more employees;
· From April to June, 7% expect to reduce their payrolls;
· From April to June, 70% expect to maintain their current staff levels and 2% are not certain of their hiring plans; and
· Overall the Net Employment Outlook is 14%--this is calculated by taking the percentage of employers anticipating an increase in hiring activity and subtracting from this the percentage of employers expecting a decrease in hiring activity.
According to the Manpower Group, the Manpower Employment Outlook Survey is conducted quarterly to measure employers' intentions to increase or decrease the number of employees in their workforces during the next quarter. The Manpower Employment Outlook Survey's United States results are based on interviews with 18,000 employers located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which includes the largest 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas based on number of business establishments.
