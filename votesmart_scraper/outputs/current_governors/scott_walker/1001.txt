Governor Scott Walker released the following statement in honor of Memorial Day:
Tonette and I wish everyone a safe and happy Memorial Day. While Memorial Day is a great chance to grill some brats and celebrate the beginning of summer, it is an honor to take this time to thank our veterans and service members for their sacrifices and service to our country. Their selflessness protects those of us here at home and the freedoms we hold so dear. Thank you to all of those who have served and to their families.
