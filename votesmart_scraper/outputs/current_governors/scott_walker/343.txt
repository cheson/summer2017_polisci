Governor Scott Walker joined local leaders in Milwaukee today to celebrate both the completion of the Hoan Bridge Project as well as the beginning of the Lakefront Gateway Project. Both of these projects will bolster economic development along Milwaukee's Lakefront area.
"Investing in our infrastructure remains one of our top priorities," Governor Walker said. "Projects like the Hoan Bridge and Lakefront Gateway boost economic development in the area. Developing safe and efficient transportation networks is a key element as we continue to help our industries transport their goods from point A to point B, make our numerous tourist destinations throughout the state more accessible, and attract new people and businesses to Wisconsin."
