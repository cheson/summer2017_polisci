Hi, Scott Walker here.
Five years ago when we took office, our state faced a $3.6 billion budget deficit.
In order to get our fiscal house back in order, we knew we needed to implement tough, but prudent reforms through something called Act 10.
In the years since we signed Act 10 into law, taxpayers have seen significant savings of over $5 billion. These reforms also allowed us to pay outstanding bills from the previous administration, balance the budget without raising taxes, and ultimately help us start moving Wisconsin forward.
We continue to see tremendous growth throughout the state. Wisconsin schools have utilized our reforms to improve education and keep teachers in the classroom. Today, graduation rates are up, reading scores are up in 4th and 8th grades, and ACT scores? Well, they are the second best in the country.
Additionally, we were able to cut both property and income taxes by a total of nearly $5 billion. Today, a typical family is paying lower property taxes than they were in 2010 and a median family of four is realizing $916 in savings from our income tax cuts over four years.
In addition, more people are working in Wisconsin than at nearly any other time in our state's history. Our unemployment rate and labor force participation rate are both better than the nation's and our labor force participation rate is in the top ten in the nation.
We remain dedicated to improving the lives of the people in our state by growing our economy, developing our workforce, transforming education, investing in our infrastructure, and reforming government. In the future, we will continue to look out for the best interests of our taxpayers by keeping more money in the hands of Wisconsin taxpayers.
