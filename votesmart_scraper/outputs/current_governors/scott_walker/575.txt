Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker will lead a trade mission of economic development officials to London in February as part of the state's efforts to encourage companies in the United Kingdom to invest in Wisconsin. Governor Walker made the announcement today at a meeting of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC).
"There are many reasons why international companies seeking to expand or relocate should consider Wisconsin, and we are proactively making that case around the world," Governor Walker said. "Wisconsin companies already have great success exporting their goods and services overseas, and that success has helped grow the state's economy. Attracting foreign investment is the logical next step of expanding on that international success."
The trip, which will take place from Feb. 9 to 13, will focus solely on attracting foreign direct investment to Wisconsin. Governor Walker and leaders from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) will meet with UK business executives about establishing new operations in Wisconsin, and providing additional capital to established state businesses to expand their Wisconsin operations and create jobs.
During the trip, Governor Walker, WEDC Secretary and CEO Reed Hall and other key WEDC leaders will have face-to-face meetings with high-level business leaders from the United Kingdom. The state delegation will specifically focus on companies that plan to expand in the U.S. in the next 12 to 36 months.
The state delegation also will meet with trade-related government officials, business associations, universities and industry clusters that align with Wisconsin's business strengths during the trip.
