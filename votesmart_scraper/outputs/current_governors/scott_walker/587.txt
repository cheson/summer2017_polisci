Today, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement on his cabinet leadership team for his second term.
"As we look forward to a new term, we are excited to keep working hard for Wisconsin, so people around our state can enjoy the prosperity that comes from hard work. Together, my leadership team and I will build upon our successes to continue moving Wisconsin forward," said Governor Walker. "We will continue reforming government to make it work better for our taxpayers, eliminating waste and streamlining repetitive bureaucracy. In the coming months, legislation will be introduced to reduce the number of agencies and aimed at a common sense approach to providing necessary services at a great value to those taxpayers. The leadership teams at the affected agencies and throughout state government will work to ensure a smooth transition."
