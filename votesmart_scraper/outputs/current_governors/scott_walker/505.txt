Today, Governor Scott Walker announced the appointment of Michael P. Screnock to replace retiring Judge Patrick J. Taggart on the Sauk County Circuit Court.
"Michael Screnock will make an excellent judge for Sauk County," Governor Walker said. "He is an accomplished and dedicated public servant with a reputation for integrity, and I am confident that he will act fairly and uphold the law."
Screnock is a native of Sauk County who has extensive experience in both litigation and local government administration, having served the cities of Reedsburg, Washburn, and Ashland in various leadership roles since 1992. In 2007, Screnock joined the law firm of Michael Best & Friedrich, where he handles a variety of civil litigation and administrative proceedings, including real estate and land use disputes, government regulation, environmental law, and election law.
Judge John Anderson of the Bayfield County Circuit Court, who first worked with Screnock when the latter was City Administrator of Washburn, highly recommends him for the appointment. "He is a man of remarkable character and has an extremely keen intellect, together with a wide and unique lifetime of practical and professional experience," Judge Anderson said of Screnock, calling him "a rare talent" and "the best and brightest our state has to offer the court system." He "possesses a calm and collective demeanor which is very appropriate for the role of a trial judge," Judge Anderson said.
Ray Taffora, a former partner at Michael Best & Friedrich, also speaks very highly of Screnock. "I have found Michael to be an exceptionally capable lawyer," Taffora wrote. "He is thoughtful, analytical, thorough, and self-effacing. All these traits, coupled with a good sense of humor, are ideal in a judge of any court of record."
