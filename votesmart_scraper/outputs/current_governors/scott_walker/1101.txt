Wisconsin Job Gains Continue
Statement

The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently published the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data for the first quarter of 2012. QCEW is based on an actual job count of more than 96 percent of employers in Wisconsin. The data shows Wisconsin continued to create jobs.
Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the published QCEW data:
Wisconsin's continued private sector job growth is good news. I am particularly pleased with the gains in the manufacturing sector, which makes up a huge portion of our state's economy.
The quarterly job count release today shows, yet again, the monthly job estimates are not accurate. I am hopeful that DWD will be able to work with the federal government to bring the monthly estimates back in line with the actual job numbers.
The fiscal reforms we put in place coupled with reforms like reducing frivolous lawsuits and bringing certainty and accountability to state regulations, have established a strong foundation for future job growth.
Moving forward, we will continue to find ways to make it easier for the people of our state to put Wisconsinites back to work.
