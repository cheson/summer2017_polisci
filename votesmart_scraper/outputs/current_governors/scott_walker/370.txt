Location: Lake Geneva, WI

Governor Scott Walker and Department of Health Services (DHS) Secretary Kitty Rhoades visited Primex Wireless, Inc. in Lake Geneva today to unveil the latest initiative in the Dementia-Capable Wisconsin program. The Dementia-Friendly Employers Toolkit is designed to provide employers with resources and tools to support employees caring for a loved one with dementia.
"One of the greatest challenges for employers across the state is hiring and retaining skilled workers," Governor Walker said. "Our aging population means more valued employees are struggling to maintain the work/life balance, because they are also working to care for a loved one living with dementia. The Dementia-Friendly Employers Toolkit offers resources and options for employers, steps they can take that will lead to lower turnover, higher productivity, and a happier, healthier workforce."
