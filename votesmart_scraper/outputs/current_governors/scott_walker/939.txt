Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker announced today he will attend the Midwest U.S.-Japan Association Conference in Tokyo September 8-10 to build trade ties between Wisconsin and Japan businesses and investors.
"Japan is very important to Wisconsin's global business activities," said Governor Walker. "Japan is our fifth largest export destination, with exports totaling $858 million in 2012. Japan is the top purchaser of Wisconsin products in the medical and scientific instruments category."
The Midwest U.S.--Japan Association Conference is held annually to discuss the growth and progress of economic relations of the American Midwest and Japan. Wisconsin hosted the 2008 Midwest U.S.-Japan Association annual joint meeting in Milwaukee. The Midwest U.S.-Japan Association is comprised of nine member states, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
"I expect Wisconsin's presence at the conference will further cement the already strong ties with, as well as encourage business development growth in the future benefitting both Japan and Wisconsin," Governor Walker said.
The Governor will be accompanied by Reed Hall, CEO and Secretary of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.
"I am optimistic about the opportunities we have to partner together to help create jobs and grow both our economies," Hall said. "I look forward to showcasing Wisconsin at the conference."
There are approximately 25 Japanese affiliated firms in Wisconsin, a majority with operations in the advanced manufacturing sector, taking advantage of one of Wisconsin's strength. Wisconsin has a number of companies with operations in Japan, including Briggs and Stratton, Promega, Harley Davidson, Johnson Controls, Manpower, and Lands' End.
