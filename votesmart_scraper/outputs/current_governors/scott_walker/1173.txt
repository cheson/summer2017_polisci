Governor Walker Signs Green Tier Executive Order
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 23, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker signed Executive Order 69 which directs the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to enhance its already existing Green Tier program to meet both environmental and economic development goals.
Green Tier is a voluntary program that recognizes and rewards environmental performance that exceeds legal requirements resulting in continuous improvement in Wisconsin's environment, economy, and quality of life. Since its inception in 2004, the Green Tier program has been providing real benefits to businesses by allowing the Department the regulatory flexibility for companies to pursue creative ways to enhance productivity and profitability.
"This program has produced enhanced, voluntary collaboration with businesses to yield environmental and economic gains aligned with their business plan as opposed to prescribing inefficient and burdensome actions that impede a productive business model," said Governor Scott Walker. "The next step is to increase program participation."
Due to the high degree of expertise needed in order to comply with the program's requirements, not all businesses are able to take advantage of its unique offerings. Following EO #69, DNR will increase access to the program by providing ready-to-use models for specific business sectors. Also, in conjunction with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, the DNR will proactively reach out to Wisconsin's businesses in order to effectively communicate the benefits of the program.
