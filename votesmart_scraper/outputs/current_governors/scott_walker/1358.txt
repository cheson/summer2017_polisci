Governor Walker's Labor Day Statement
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Sept. 5, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker issued the following statement:
Wisconsin is home to a world class workforce. Our outstanding workers are the single most valuable and important asset we have when attempting to attract and retain employers in Wisconsin. This is extremely important to highlight on Labor Day as we move forward with our plan to ensure we have an economic climate that allows the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs by 2015.
While our state and national economy have suffered over the past few years, I am optimistic about our future. When I hear stories about people who find jobs that provide a family supporting income, it reaffirms my belief that by working together we will get Wisconsin working again.
It will be the people of our state, the hardworking Wisconsinites, who will rebuild our economy, improve our communities, and ultimately move our state forward.
