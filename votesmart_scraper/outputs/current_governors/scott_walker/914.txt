ICYMI: No Health Care Coverage Gap in Wisconsin
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Oct. 21, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

A recent study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that of the 26 states choosing not to expand Medicaid programs as a part of the Affordable Care Act, Wisconsin is the only state that will not have a gap in health care coverage.
Department of Health Services Secretary Kitty Rhoades highlighted the news in a recent press release:
"Kaiser's study reinforces the bold Wisconsin-specific solution Governor Walker made when he reformed Medicaid," said Department of Health Services Secretary Kitty Rhoades. "For the first time in Wisconsin's history, all adults living in poverty will have access to the same level of benefits through Wisconsin's Medicaid program. These reforms ensure long-term sustainability and predictability for a program that serves those who are most in need in our state as well as protect Wisconsin taxpayers from the unpredictability of federal funding."
