Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker announced the 2011 tourism economic impact numbers, with stops planned in the Wausau, Eau Claire, and Green Bay areas. Governor Walker took a ride on the Zippin Pippin at Bay Beach in Green Bay to highlight the news. The Zippin Pippin is known as Elvis Presley's favorite roller coaster. It was reconstructed at the Green Bay amusement park, and ridership exceeded expectations during its first year.
"2011 was a tremendous year for the travel and hospitality industry in Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "Tourism is a core industry in Wisconsin. The data released today shows that the investment we've made in tourism marketing and has enhanced the image of the state."
Tourism Economy Grew by 7.6%
The tourism economy in Wisconsin picked up steam in 2011. Visitor spending of $10 billion generated $16 billion in total business sales, up 7.6% from $14.8 billion in 2010, according to research conducted by Tourism Economics. More than 95 million people visited the state, supporting 181,000 jobs and $4.4 billion in personal income. Lodging sales increased 18% from 2009. Visitors generated $1.3 billion in state and local revenue and $950 million federal taxes in 2011, saving Wisconsin taxpayers nearly $565 per household. Spending from visitors increased more than 20% in Columbia, Fond du Lac, Monroe Counties. A summary of the study is available and includes individual economic impact for all 72 counties.
Tourism Campaign Success
Last year's "Picture the Fun" campaign motivated more than 2.1 million visits last summer and fall, helping to generating an additional $257 million in tourism spending and $22 million in tax revenue according to Longwoods International, a tourism consulting firm that conducted the study for the Department of Tourism. For every $1 dollar the Department spent on the $3.5 million advertising campaign, $6 was returned to state and local governments in incremental tax revenue.
Recognizing the economic benefits of investing in tourism, Governor Walker increased the state's $9.9 million tourism budget by $5 million over the 2011 and 2012 biennium. In comparison, Illinois has a $44 million tourism budget. Michigan's is $30 million.
Longwoods International is a globally recognized leader in travel research, with over 30 years of experience with a hospitality client list that includes Michigan, Ohio, Philadelphia and Canada. Tourism Economics is an Oxford Economics company that provides analyses of the tourism sector.
