Hi. Scott Walker here.
This week, I signed into law the H.O.P.E. legislative package -- which stands for Heroin Opiate Prevention and Education. Heroin use has spiked in Wisconsin and across the country in recent years, devastating families and putting loved ones at risk -- regardless of gender, age, race, income, or zip code.
I want to personally thank Representative John Nygren for his dedication and hard work on this important legislation. This is a deeply personal issue for Representative Nygren and an important step in helping our families, our friends, and neighbors who are struggling with heroin addictions.
These bills draw attention to the very serious problem of opiate abuse in Wisconsin. In 2012, for example, heroin overdose deaths rose by almost 50 percent. The H.O.P.E. legislative package invests in Wisconsin's communities by giving law enforcement and first responders the tools they need to be more effectively able to address opiate abuse across the state, while also helping those who are struggling with addiction by providing alternatives to incarceration.
We want to make sure our citizens and our communities have access to the resources they need to combat this deadly addiction. The H.O.P.E. legislative package lays the foundation for reversing the dangerous trend of heroin addiction.
