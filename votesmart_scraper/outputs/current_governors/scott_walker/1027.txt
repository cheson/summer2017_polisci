Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 17, 2013
Location: Harbin, China

Today, Governor Scott Walker met with acting Governor Lu Hao of the Heilongjiang Province and celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Wisconsin -- Heilongjiang Sister State Agreement.
"Over the last 30 years, a strong friendship has been built thanks to the yearly missions by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection," said Governor Walker. "I am excited to have the chance to celebrate 30 years of cooperation and exchanges of cultural and economic views."
On October 18, 1982, Governor Lee Sherman Dreyfus of Wisconsin and Governor Chen Lei of Heilongjiang Province signed an Agreement on the Establishment of Relations of Friendship. The intent was to foster a relationship based on equality, respect, and reciprocal benefit. Yearly agricultural missions have promoted this relationship and continued the exchange of ideas.
