Hi, this is Scott Walker.
This weekend marked the official start of summer. It's an exciting time of year, with so much to do and experience all across our great state. It's also an exciting time here in the State Capitol, as we continue working together on a budget that best serves you -- the citizens of Wisconsin.
As we move forward with the budget process our priorities have not changed. I continue to meet and talk regularly with lawmakers about issues important to them, as well as the last few remaining items in the budget.
Working together, we can continue our work to move Wisconsin forward by creating jobs, transforming education, developing our workforce, reforming government, and improving our infrastructure. We want a government that our taxpayers can afford and part of that is my pledge to keep property taxes lower in 2016 than they were in 2010. This budget does just that.
I look forward to continuing our work with lawmakers and stakeholders to finalize a budget that makes state government more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the taxpayers, so we can build a better future for all of Wisconsin.
