This week, the Marquette Law School Poll measured majority support for expanding school choice and also showed strong support for Governor Walker's other education reforms.
"The Marquette poll confirms what I hear frequently from parents and others who tell me they support a quality education system and believe in parental choice, especially for low-income children in under-performing schools," said Governor Walker. "Every child, regardless of his or her family's income, deserves access to a great education. Our budget helps realize that goal by expanding school choice to low-income families with children in under-performing schools, based on the state's impartial school report cards."
Some highlights from the Marquette survey:
· Expansion of school vouchers is supported by 51%, including 37% who would like to see a statewide expansion. This is compared with only 28% who would rather not have the program and 14% who prefer the status quo.
· Support for school choice expansion is strong in areas across the state, including Green Bay (49%), Madison (51%), and strongest in the City of Milwaukee (56%), where residents are most familiar with the program's success.
· Vouchers are also viewed favorably in the state, albeit with a large number of residents undecided, especially in areas without vouchers.
· Charter schools are also viewed very favorably (42%-16%), while residents also support adding new charter schools, and overwhelmingly recognize the flexibility they provide in order to meet student needs.
· On other education questions, residents support their public schools and teachers and also back Governor Walker's proposal (53%-42%) to improve teacher quality by removing government imposed restrictions on where public employees, including teachers, can live.
