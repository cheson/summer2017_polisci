Over the past several months, I've had the privilege of traveling around the country with Our American Revival, sharing our message of how to tackle difficult problems and repeatedly win tough policy fights with bold, conservative reforms. We've spoken with thousands of hard-working Americans, and the response has been incredible.
But we've done more than just talk. We've listened. In state after state, the message we are hearing from people is simple: America needs a new leader -- from outside of Washington -- with a record of not just talking about conservative principles, but fighting for them and winning with them.
I have heard these voices loud and clear. That's why I am launching a testing the waters committee to gauge support for a presidential run. This will be the final step before I decide whether I become a candidate for our nation's highest office, and I urge you to sign up at ScottWalker.com so you can be among the first to know when I have made this important decision.
There are many accomplished people eyeing the GOP nomination for president. Some want you to think they fight. But speeches aren't fighting or winning. Others have won elections but haven't fought any big fights. In Wisconsin, we have a record of doing both.
As I came into office, the state faced a $3.6 billion deficit, the rainy day fund was nearly drained and state and local officials were hamstrung by big-government special interests. We turned the state around using a strategy that's rare in politics: we stood on principles and fought for them relentlessly. We got the job done.
