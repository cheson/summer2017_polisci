Today, Governor Scott Walker announced the launch of One Stop Business Portal, a new online service to make it easier than ever for businesses to be created online, any time. One Stop Business Portal is now live at www.OpenForBusinessWI.com. Today's launch marks the first of multiple phases for this new online service. Future phases may include permits, licenses, and registrations from additional departments, as well as services that current businesses may use.
"We are making it easier for businesses to start and operate in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "The One Stop Business Portal allows job creators access to the resources they need in one convenient location, making government more effective, more efficient, and more accountable. By eliminating the need for people to visit three agencies, we have streamlined the process for job creators in Wisconsin."
