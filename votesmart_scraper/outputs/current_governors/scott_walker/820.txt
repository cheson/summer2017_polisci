Hi, this is Scott Walker.
One of my top priorities is to lower the overall tax burden every year I am in office. Last month in the State of the State address, I proposed a Blueprint for Prosperity to put more than $800 million back in the hands of our state's hardworking taxpayers. Our plan cuts income taxes by nearly $100 million, adjusts withholding for state income taxes by over $322 million, and cuts property taxes by more than $400 million. The typical homeowner will save over $100 on their next property tax bill, and property taxes in 2014 are projected to be lower than they were in 2010.
People all across the state don't tell me that taxes are too low, or even that they are just right. Overwhelmingly, people tell me that reducing the tax burden is one of the best ways to fuel our economic recovery. And -- I believe -- it is your money, and you deserve to keep more of it.
Last year, we passed a biennial budget, which included nearly $1 billion in tax relief for Wisconsin families and businesses. But we didn't stop there. A few months later, thanks to higher than expected growth in state revenues, we passed an additional $100 million in property tax relief for Wisconsin property owners. It was much needed relief for families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses all across our state. Once our Blueprint for Prosperity is passed, the total tax relief provided since I took office will be $2 billion.
But there's more work to be done. Yesterday, I announced my commitment to holding the line on property taxes by ensuring the state property tax burden in 2018 is lower than it is 2014. I look forward to working with the Legislature and gathering public input to determine how to make that goal a reality.
