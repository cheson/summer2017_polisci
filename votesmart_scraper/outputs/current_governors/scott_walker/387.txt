Governor Scott Walker joined high school staff, teachers, students, and community leaders today at Stoughton High School to tour their FAB Lab and promote their efforts to train Wisconsin's next generation of workers. The Working for Wisconsin tour highlights initiatives and programs throughout the state that are working for the people of Wisconsin.
"Stoughton High School is the second high school in the United States and the first high school in Wisconsin to have a FAB lab," Governor Walker said. "This unique addition to their school curriculum gives students a jump-start and provides them with real-life skills and training relating to manufacturing. Important resources like FAB Labs not only provide Wisconsin's students with a future in a good-paying career, they help to ensure the future of our workforce as well."
