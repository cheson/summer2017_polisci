Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker visited St. Anthony's High School today to celebrate National School Choice Week with the non-profit organization, Hispanics for School Choice.
"National School Choice Week highlights the unique educational options available to students in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "No one model will fit all of our students, and I am proud that our education system gives parents the ability to choose what is best for their child."
Hispanics for School Choice works to educate Hispanics and raise awareness of educational choices, remove restrictions hindering a parent's choice, and increase the number of school choices for students. The group hosts outreach events throughout the year, in addition to events during National School Choice week. Last August, the non-profit sponsored a backpack drive, which collected a thousand backpacks for students.
National School Choice Week runs January 26th to February 1st. Thousands of events held across the country highlight the various educational options available to students.
