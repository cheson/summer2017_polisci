Location: Mondovi, WI

Governor Scott Walker celebrated National Truck Driver Appreciation Week today at Marten Transport. Marten Transport was founded in 1946 and is one of the largest refrigerated carriers in the United States.
"Trucking is a driving force in our economy," Governor Walker said. "Businesses need to be able to get their products to the final destination by the fastest and most efficient means. Our truck drivers log hundreds of thousands of miles on the road, helping companies meet their business demands."
National Truck Driver Appreciation Week is sponsored by the American Trucking Associations (ATA). ATA has worked since 1933 to develop and advocate innovative, research-based policies that promote highway safety, security, environmental sustainability, and profitability.
The trucking industry is continually finding ways to be competitive. There are nearly 3.1 million truck drivers in the United States and these drivers average between 100,000 to 110,000 miles of driving per year. In 2012, trucks across the country moved 9.4 billion tons of freight. The trucking industry in Wisconsin supports 161,000 jobs and includes 22,000 trucking companies. Wisconsin trucks handle almost 61 percent of all freight tonnage.
Marten Transport is a premier supplier of time and temperature sensitive transportation services. Roger Marten founded the company while delivering milk and dairy products. The company provides services to 48 states, Canada, and Mexico. They were first place winners of Truckload Carriers Association Safety's contest in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 and the grand prize winner in 2001. Marten is hiring for 60 open positions.
