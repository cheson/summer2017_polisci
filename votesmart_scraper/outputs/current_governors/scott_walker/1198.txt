Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Walker joined local officials in Brown Deer today to announce the documented savings for taxpayers from Act 10 reforms have now exceeded $1 billion, less than one year after the law went into effect.
"This is a great day for the hardworking people of this state who pay for the expenses of government," Governor Walker said. "I want to commend the local leaders of school districts, villages, cities, and counties who rolled up their sleeves and put our reforms to work for them. They are finding new ways to be more efficient, while still maintaining and improving services. This is just the beginning. We are turning things around, and this is a fantastic start."
Representatives from the Brown Deer School District, the New Berlin School District, Ozaukee County, Racine County and the Village of Richfield, joined the Governor to talk about the benefits of the reforms.
BROWN DEER SCHOOL DISTRICT
The Brown Deer School District hosted the Governor's visit, and showed him visual evidence of how the reforms are working. Before Act 10, Brown Deer school officials say they had put off much needed building maintenance and renovations. Following Act 10, voters approved a referendum allowing not only renovations, but a revitalization of the 64 acre campus, including an outdoor science classroom and extra gymnasium, art, and cafeteria space. School officials say without the 4% drop in taxes due to the Governor's reforms, they would not have been able to consider the referendum.
"Before Act 10, we were faced with losing 20 teachers. Act 10 not only allowed us to save those jobs, but now we are seeing our ultimate renovation project come to life, " said Emily Koczela, Brown Deer School District Finance Director.
