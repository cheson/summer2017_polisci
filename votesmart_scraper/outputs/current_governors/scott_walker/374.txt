Location: Green Bay, WI

Governor Scott Walker spoke today at the 5th Annual Manufacturing First Expo and Conference, which was held this year at the KI Convention Center in Green Bay. This annual event is the largest manufacturing-focused conference in the state.
"We are a national leader in manufacturing, and this is an exciting time for manufacturers in Wisconsin," Governor Walker said. "Their demand is up and they need more skilled workers to fill their open positions and meet their customers' orders. We remain committed to investing in programs that help to train these prospective employees, so they are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in a family-supporting career in this fast-paced industry. Companies like the ones here at the Manufacturing First Expo and Conference are important job creators in Wisconsin, and we will continue to do our part to improve the business climate in our state, so it's easier for them to grow and thrive."
