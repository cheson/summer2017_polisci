Governor Scott Walker Attends 74th Annual Badger Boys State Inauguration
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: June 18, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Tonight, Governor Scott Walker addresses the young men from across the state selected to attend Badger Boys State, a unique 8-day experience in which participants are grouped into cities and counties to form a "51st state." Throughout the week, students elect their own municipal, county, and state officials in order to carry out the primary functions of the city, county, and state, thus allowing them to better understand representation and government in America.
"The Badger Boys State Inauguration is something I look forward to every year," Governor Walker said. "As a Badger Boys State alum, I know first-hand what a valuable experience this is, and as these boys work together throughout the week, they not only begin to understand what it takes to effectively and efficiently run a government, but also how crucial it is to communicate and work as a team to accomplish your goals. There is no doubt in my mind the knowledge and skills they gain here will help them excel in the future."
Badger Boys State is a program of the American Legion Department of Wisconsin, and every year, approximately 870 men throughout Wisconsin are nominated to attend this week-long event at Ripon College. In order to attend, students must be between their junior and senior year of high school, and be enrolled in a Wisconsin high school or homeschool. While scholarship is important, potential leaders are not always the top of their class, though ideal participants for Badger Boys State are typically in the upper third of their class.
