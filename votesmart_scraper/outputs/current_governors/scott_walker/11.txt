Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield announced its intention to withdraw from the Obamacare Exchange in Wisconsin:
"Obamacare is collapsing. Growing uncertainty in the health insurance market was created by Obamacare's costly regulations and it is causing higher premiums and a lack of options. If we do nothing, more companies will back out and more people will lose coverage. Wisconsin families expect and deserve better health care coverage options and the time to act is now."
