Governor Walker Discusses State Agency Mergers at Joint Meeting of WEDC and WHEDA Boards
Press Release
By: Scott Walker

Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker participated in a joint meeting of the boards of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA) today in Milwaukee to discuss the consolidation of the two agencies.
"The merger of state services will ultimately aid in guaranteeing state government is more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the public," Governor Walker said. "Our unemployment rate in the state is down to 4.6 percent, significantly lower than the national rate of 5.5 percent. Our efforts to keep spending in check means that you, the taxpayers, get to keep more of your own money and, looking forward, your spending helps to fuel Wisconsin's economy."
The creation of the Forward Wisconsin Development Authority (Forward WI) will hone in to focus on economic development and housing needs, and will allow for greater cooperation at the grassroots level with local, regional, and private sector partners, which help strengthen Wisconsin's economy.
The goal of this and other mergers is to create a state government that is more accessible to the public, less intrusive in the lives of Wisconsinites, and more effectively serves the people of the state.
