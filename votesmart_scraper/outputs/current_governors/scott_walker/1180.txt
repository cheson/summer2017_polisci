"By all measures, Wisconsin's economy, job climate, and financial outlook are all doing well since Governor Walker took office," said Ciara Matthews, Walker campaign spokeswoman.

Governor Scott Walker:
I've got some bad news for Tom Barrett, but good news for Wisconsin.
The government just released the final job numbers, and as it turns out,
Wisconsin actually gained, that's right, gained more than 20,000 new jobs during my first year in office.
Add the jobs created this year, and the total grows to over 30,000.
Mayor Barrett, you said this election is about jobs; I couldn't agree more.
Out reforms are working and we're moving Wisconsin forward.
