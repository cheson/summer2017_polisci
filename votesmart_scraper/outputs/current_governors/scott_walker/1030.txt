Governor Scott Walker Submits Comment on Keystone Pipeline
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 15, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker submitted the following statement in support of the expansion for the Keystone XL Pipeline:
I urge Secretary Kerry to move swiftly on the expansion of the Keystone Pipeline. The expansion of the pipeline is our chance to have a new North American energy source. Expanding the pipeline will produce 830,000 barrels of oil per day, which will have an enormously positive economic impact.
In addition, if the pipeline is approved in a timely manner, countless jobs in the United States stand to be created. Wisconsin has an opportunity to benefit from this job growth, specifically for employers like the Michels Company.
Public comments to the State Department regarding the pipeline can be emailed to keystonecomments@state.gov.
