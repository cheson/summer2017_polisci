Today, Governor Scott Walker and First Lady Tonette Walker met with Cabinet leaders at the Wisconsin State Fair. The fair runs through Sunday, August 10.
"There's no better way to kick off our week than a meeting at the State Fair," said Governor Walker. "It is great opportunity for members of the cabinet to come see all the vendors and the unique Wisconsin products that are featured here each year. The State Fair is a great tradition that draws crowds from all across Wisconsin, and holding our meeting here allows us to interact with the people we work for and see the work some of them do."
First Lady Tonette Walker provided an update about her work with trauma-informed care through her Fostering Futures initiative. The mission of Fostering Futures is to promote the integration of trauma-informed practices in all systems affecting children and families, supported by state policies that make this practice work, leading to the long-term goal of improving health and socio-economic outcomes for families and children in Wisconsin.
The Wisconsin State Fair hours are 8AM-11PM Sunday-Thursday, 8AM-12AM Friday-Saturday, and 8AM-10PM the final Sunday. For more information about the Wisconsin State Fair please visit the Fair website, http://www.wistatefair.com or download the official Wisconsin State Fair mobile app.
