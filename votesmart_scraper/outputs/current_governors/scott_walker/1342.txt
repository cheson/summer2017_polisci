Today Governor Walker released the following statement:
Today the Legislature is set to take action on a number of issues, with a focus on transportation related bills that were included in my call for the Back to Work Wisconsin Special Session. Both the Senate and Assembly are taking up bills which will make it easier for commerce to take place on Wisconsin's roadways. I expect these transportation related bills to receive support from legislators from all across Wisconsin.
Additionally I am pleased that legislation to move forward advanced manufacturing skills grants for tech colleges is on today's calendar.
Bipartisan action will continue today. As I remained focused on improving Wisconsin's economy, I am hopeful that Democrats and Republicans will continue to join together to get Wisconsin working again.
