Governor Scott Walker Joins Coalition of Governors Challenging Unconstitutional Executive Lawmaking
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 4, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined the Governors of Texas, Alabama, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota in signing a brief objecting to unilateral lawmaking by the President. The brief, filed today in the U.S. Supreme Court, challenges President Obama's promulgation of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program as an unconstitutional usurpation of official lawmaking authority belonging to Congress.
"No one is above the law," Governor Walker said. "The President has a constitutional duty to comply with and faithfully execute the laws of the land. The Constitution is also clear that no president may unilaterally assume the power of Congress to create or rewrite laws. This brief challenges the President's overreach and addresses the consequences of limitless executive power under our three branch government system."
Twenty-six states, including Wisconsin, joined a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas challenging President Obama's sidestepping of Congress to grant deferred action. The district court granted a stay preventing the enforcement of President Obama's executive action and the Fifth Circuit upheld this injunction. The case, United States v. Texas, is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
