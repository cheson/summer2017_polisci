Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 6, 2016
Location: River Falls, WI

Governor Scott Walker attended the grand opening of the Options for Women Clinic in River Falls today.
"We applaud Options for Women for their dedication to providing free, quality services to women while respecting and protecting human life," Governor Walker said. "This new space will allow Options for Women to offer expanded services including counseling, pregnancy testing, and ultrasounds."
"The clinic will focus on educating moms and dads as they prepare for the arrival of their baby through their Learn to Earn program," added Governor Walker. "They earn points as they learn about parenting and birthing that they can then spend in the on-site boutique."
The boutique will offer baby and maternity clothes, car seats, and other baby gear.
In 1982, Pregnancy Helpline was founded to provide counseling, free pregnancy tests and material assistance to women in crisis pregnancies. In 2015, the Pregnancy Helpline adopted a new name --Options for Women -- as well as a new commitment to create a clinic providing a safe, professional, and trusting atmosphere for women, men, and families facing an unplanned pregnancy. Options for Women operates under a 501(c)(3) non-profit status and is funded entirely by donations.
