Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today after the Wisconsin State Senate passed a measure that would provide $100 million in property tax relief:
I'm pleased to see the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate come together to provide $100 million in property tax relief for Wisconsin families, farmers, seniors, and small businesses. Our tough, but prudent, decisions mean we can invest in Wisconsin's priorities, and one of those is holding the line on property taxes in this state. I look forward to the Assembly's vote on Thursday.
