Hi everyone, Scott Walker here.
Happy Thanksgiving.
My family and I have so much to be thankful for this year -- Our health and happiness, and the strength and support we get from so many great people across the state. I am so very thankful for the opportunity to serve as your Governor for a second term.
Tonette and I would like to wish all of you and your families an abundance of blessings this coming year. May your home be filled with love, and your table set with turkey and stuffing -- and of course, delicious Wisconsin cranberries!
I hope you have a wonderful day with family and friends, making great memories. To all of you, from all of us, Happy Thanksgiving.
