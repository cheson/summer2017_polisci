By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 6, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today encouraging Wisconsinites to wear red today for National Wear Red Day:
The American Heart Association celebrates Heart Month every February to raise awareness about heart disease, the number one killer of women. The first Friday of February is National Wear Red Day. Wearing red today calls attention to the staggering fact that one in three women deal with cardiovascular illness and promotes making healthy lifestyle changes, which can decrease the risk of future heart disease by 80 percent. Please join Tonette and me as we wear red today for women.
The Executive Residence is lit red until midnight tonight in support of Wear Red Day. The American Heart Association has resources available at: http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/
