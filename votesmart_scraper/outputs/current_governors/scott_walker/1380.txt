Governor Scott Walker today signed into law the 2011-13 budget which balances a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes and continues to support critical services, while promoting job growth and investing in education.
"Our balanced budget makes tough choices while providing a path to recovery and prosperity for our state and our people," Governor Walker said. "Through honest budgeting, we are providing an alternative to the reckless tricks and gimmicks of the past."
The Governor's budget, without raising taxes, eliminates a $3.6 billion deficit and builds a platform for better budgets in the future. In doing so, it eliminates a deficit of nearly $650 for every man, woman and child in Wisconsin. Only seven states in the nation faced larger per capita deficits than Wisconsin.
"Just as any parent would dread leaving their kids in debt, it is the dream of every mother and father to leave their children a little better off, and that's what our budget will do," said Governor Walker.
The Governor's budget protects taxpayers by implementing a true property tax freeze and promoting job growth. The property tax freeze will save the average homeowner over $700 dollars over the next two years.
The Governor said, "it's my hope that due to this budget, thousands of Wisconsinites can breathe just a little bit easier and not worry about how they're going to stay in the home they love."
The budget also includes a manufacturing tax credit and capital gains tax credit aimed at creating jobs in Wisconsin.
