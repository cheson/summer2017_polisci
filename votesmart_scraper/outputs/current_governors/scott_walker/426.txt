To honor and recognize the significant impact of the Americans with Disability Act, Governor Scott Walker has proclaimed Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 25th Anniversary Day. The ADA was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush on July 26, 1990.
"The Americans with Disabilities Act is a landmark piece of legislation," Governor Walker said. "It protects people with disabilities against discrimination in the workforce, so they may enjoy the freedom and independence that come with employment. Here in Wisconsin, we celebrate what an incredible asset people with disabilities are as employees, with our Year of A Better Bottom Line initiative. We continue to invest in important programs such as Project SEARCH, as we remain focused on building opportunities so everyone who wants a good job, can get a good job."
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) restricts discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, school, transportation, and all public places open to the general public. The law is intended to ensure that people with disabilities have equal rights and opportunities.
Governor Walker's Year of A Better Bottom Line is about highlighting the benefits of employing people with disabilities in the workplace, encouraging increased participation by individuals and public and private employers, and investing in programs that assist in integrating persons with disabilities into the workforce. It is tailored after Delaware Governor Jack Markell's initiative with the National Governor's Association, which laid out the numerous benefits for employers, employees, and communities.
