Governor Scott Walker today directed the Department of Health Services (DHS) to evaluate and implement six strategies strengthening the state's public assistance programs by increasing fraud prevention and giving DHS access to more information that it can use to verify individuals and families are eligible for public assistance benefits.
"Our job in tracking and preventing fraud in Wisconsin's public assistance programs is never done," said Governor Walker. "Today, I'm announcing a series of six fraud prevention strategies that the Department of Health Services will evaluate and implement in order to renew our investment in protecting taxpayer dollars and make sure only those who are truly eligible are receiving benefits and services through the state's public assistance programs. Our public assistance programs are a safety net for individuals and families in need, and in order to keep these programs viable and sustainable over the long-term, the integrity of these programs must be maintained."
"One of the Department's top priorities is to make sure we are providing essential safety net benefits, like BadgerCare Plus and FoodShare to individuals and families in poverty while ensuring Wisconsin's valuable taxpayer dollars are being spent in the most efficient, effective way possible," said DHS Secretary Kitty Rhoades. "The Department's leadership team, along with our Office of the Inspector General, will implement the Governor's recommendations, where possible, through changes to administrative code, and for any changes that require statutory changes or amendments to existing waivers with the federal government, we will partner with the federal government and members of the our local legislature to make these changes."
Governor Walker's six strategies for increasing fraud prevention and detection include:
Strategy One: Pilot a front-end verification project at Milwaukee Enrollment Services (MilES) to review all applications in which an applicant indicates a household member is self-employed to determine if any additional proof is needed before the case is fully processed.
