Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker has requested a USDA Secretarial Disaster Designation for some Wisconsin counties that suffered crop losses due to a late freeze and frost in May. The request covers growers in Langlade, Lincoln, and Marathon Counties, where Ginseng farmers lost 28 percent of their crop and 50 percent of their seed.
"Wisconsin is the leading producer of Ginseng in the nation, and the late cold snap was devastating for some farmers," Governor Walker said. "This declaration will offer some assistance, as the impact will last several years."
A Disaster Declaration would allow farmers in the affected counties, as well as contiguous counties, to apply for emergency loans.
