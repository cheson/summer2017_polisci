Governor Scott Walker released the following statement regarding the Assembly's vote on the college affordability legislative package:
The Assembly has taken a big step forward in helping make college more affordable and transparent for Wisconsin students and families. We thank the Assembly for their support of our College Affordability package, which builds off our historic four-year tuition freeze and will help ensure that everyone who wants a job can find a job in our state. We look forward to continuing our work to keep college costs down and lower the burden of student loan debt. Our thanks to Representatives Murphy, Heaton, and Macco for authoring the bills in this package. We encourage the Senate to pass these important reforms to benefit Wisconsin citizens.
The college affordability legislative package includes six bills that will focus on making higher education more affordable by:
· Allowing full deduction of student loan interest on state income taxes;
· Increasing need-based Wisconsin grants for technical colleges to help an additional 1,000 Wisconsin students on top of the 5,000 students who benefitted from other assistance under our Blueprint for Prosperity;
· Expanding the emergency grants program for students at technical colleges and two-year UW Collages;
· Increasing internships within the UW System to help students develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in a career;
· Looking to expand transparency by sending information to students each year about their current and projected student loan debt level and education costs.
