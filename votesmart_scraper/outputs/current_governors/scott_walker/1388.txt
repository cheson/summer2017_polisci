Today Governor Walker applauded the Legislature for passing a bill that requires photo ID for voting.
"Protecting the integrity of our elections is central to ensuring our government has the full faith and confidence of the citizens it represents," Governor Walker said. "Requiring photo identification to vote will go a long way to eliminate the threat of voter fraud. If you need an ID to buy cold medicine, it's reasonable to require it to vote. I would like to thank Senator Leibham and Representative Stone for their years of leadership on this common sense piece of legislation."
