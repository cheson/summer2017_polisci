Sends Letter to Army Corps of Engineers Urging Them to Listen to Concerns of the Public
Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor, today sent a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers requesting a public hearing on the environmental impact of the proposed $810 million Milwaukee to Madison high-speed rail project. Walker joins Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner who yesterday sent a similar letter.

"Jim Doyle and Tom Barrett are rushing to build this train as quickly as they possibly can because they know the people of Wisconsin don't want it, and I will stop it," said Walker. "It is important that the public be given a right to voice their concerns over, not only the outrageous cost of this project, but also on the less discussed environmental impact, especially on wetlands."

"The last hearing on this project took place in 2001 when the project called for the destruction of 13.5 acres of wetlands, yet the latest application for this project calls for the destruction of 23.8 acres -- a 76% increase! Wisconsinites deserve to know these facts and have an opportunity to voice their concerns."
