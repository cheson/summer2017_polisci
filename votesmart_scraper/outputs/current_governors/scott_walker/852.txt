Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 28, 2014
Location: Wisconsin Dells, WI

Governor Walker delivered remarks at the 26th Biennial Apprenticeship Conference themed "The Apprenticeship Solution: Meeting the Workforce Challenge," held at Chula Vista in the Wisconsin Dells today. Nearly 600 high school students, as well as job creators, educators, and union and trade representatives attended the three-day event.
"Apprenticeship is a key asset in our efforts to help people get the skills they need for the jobs available today," Governor Walker said. "We invested $100 million dollars in my last budget on a comprehensive plan to develop our workforce. As of November, the number of apprentices is up 34 percent from the year before. In December, I signed legislation to add at least 500 more high school students to the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program. We have made great strides, and we will continue to work to make sure everyone who wants a good job, can get a good job."
2013 Act 57, signed by Governor Walker, creates an apprenticeship tuition reimbursement program, which enables apprentices or their sponsors to apply for tuition reimbursement up to 25 percent of the training cost or $1,000 per apprentice, whichever is less.
