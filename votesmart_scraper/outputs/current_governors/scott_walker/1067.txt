Today, Governor announced a $3.75 million state taxpayer investment in the UW Carbone Cancer Center Investment to accelerate the development of and access to cutting-edge molecular imaging technology developed by the Center.
"Cancer is one of Wisconsin's deadliest health problems," said Governor Walker. "This investment will leverage investment in the private sector to help the Wisconsin Oncology Network of Imaging Excellence, which will provide better access to diagnostics and treatment in rural areas. I am hopeful by making targeted investments the state can partner with the private sector to ensure Wisconsin remains on the cutting edge of healthcare systems."
According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in Wisconsin, 11,268 Wisconsinites were killed by cancer in 2010, more than one person every hour and nearly a quarter of all deaths in the state that year. A recent study found that the cost of cancer treatment in Wisconsin is expected to grow to $4 billion by the end of 2015. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 30,000 Wisconsinites were diagnosed with cancer in 2010 or 81 people every day.
Governor Walker's budget proposal supports the creation of the Wisconsin Oncology Network of Imaging Excellence, along with funding imaging research related equipment and expansion of the Wisconsin Oncology Network. State funding is contingent on DOA approval of a plan to obtain a fundraising match.
