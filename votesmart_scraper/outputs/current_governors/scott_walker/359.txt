Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined AT&T officials, leaders from Bunker Labs, and Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) Secretary John Scocos today in announcing a $10,000 AT&T Innovation Award to launch Bunker Labs @ Wisconsin. This award will support Bunker Labs' efforts to help military veterans start and grow businesses in Wisconsin.
"It's great to be here at University Research Park today as we announce AT&T's grant to support Bunker Labs in our state," Governor Walker said. "Our veterans have risked their lives so we can enjoy our freedoms and upon their return, we want to ensure they have all the support and resources they need to find family-supporting jobs or even start their own businesses. AT&T and Bunker Labs are helping us in reaching that goal and will help to accelerate opportunities for Wisconsin's veterans, their spouses, and families."
