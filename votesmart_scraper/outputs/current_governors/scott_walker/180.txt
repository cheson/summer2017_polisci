Governor Scott Walker joined local partners today in celebrating the graduation of eleven Project SEARCH interns at the Milwaukee County Zoo.

"The Milwaukee County Zoo continues to support students with disabilities in their mission to acquire relevant and marketable skills that will allow them to use their unique abilities to contribute to Wisconsin's growing economy."
Project SEARCH is a one-year internship program providing training and education to young adults with disabilities ages 18-25. Since 2008, the program has facilitated the professional development of over 450 graduates in Wisconsin. According to the latest statistics, approximately 87 percent of Wisconsin graduates were employed upon program completion, beating the national Project SEARCH employment rate average by more than 15 percent.
