Press Release

Location: Watertown, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 145 into law today at Marine Corps League Aero Park. Senate Bill 145 increases penalties for traffic offenses committed while sanitation workers are present. Current law protects only highway construction and maintenance workers.
"Wisconsin's sanitation workers are subject to the same risks as highway construction and maintenance workers, yet they did not have the same protection under the law. Now, they do," Governor Walker said. "Hopefully, drivers across the state will recognize the risks posed to sanitation workers and slow down to protect them and prevent accidents. I thank Senator Paul Farrow (R-Pewaukee) and Representative John Jagler (R-Watertown) for their leadership on this bill."
Senate Bill 145 will increase protection for sanitation workers by doubling the minimum and maximum fines for speeding violations and reckless driving. The bill was authored after sanitation worker and Marine Corps veteran Mark Friend suffered serious injuries in an accident in January 2013. The legislation passed the Senate on a 32 -- 0 vote and the Assembly concurred on a voice vote. Senate Bill 145 is Act 39.
