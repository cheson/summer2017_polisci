Hi, Scott Walker here.
One of the most important things we're doing to move Wisconsin forward is to invest in our workforce through worker training programs, such as youth apprenticeship, dual enrollment, and Project SEARCH.
Throughout the month of June, we've been traveling throughout the state to celebrate our most recent Project SEARCH graduates.
This week, we also joined the completion ceremonies of Sauk Prairie Healthcare and the Milwaukee County Zoo Project SEARCH graduates.
Project SEARCH is a win-win for Wisconsin youth with disabilities and employers alike. The program combines on-site work experience in a business environment with classroom instruction to allow participants the opportunity to develop hands-on skills that they'll use when they transition into Wisconsin's workforce.
We modeled Project SEARCH after Delaware Governor Jack Markell's initiative with the National Governor's Association. We loved that his initiative sought to empower and support youth with disabilities who seek to join the workforce.
That's why in 2014, we introduced the year of "A Better Bottom Line" and made significant investments to expand Project SEARCH throughout Wisconsin.
Project SEARCH is about overcoming obstacles to employment for youth with disabilities and about allowing participants to showcase and utilize their unique abilities in Wisconsin's workforce. We're proud of all of our Project SEARCH graduates, and we can't wait to see all they accomplish in the brighter futures ahead for them.
