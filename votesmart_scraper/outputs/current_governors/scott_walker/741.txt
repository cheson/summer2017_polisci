Governor Scott Walker Promotes National Small Business Week
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 13, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today encouraged small businesses in Wisconsin to participate in National Small Business Week, celebrated this year May 12-16, 2014. National Small Business Week, hosted since 1963, is a chance to highlight and promote the economic impact of entrepreneurs and small business owners.
"Each day, small business owners turn their dreams into realities, putting their talents and dedication to work at the business they built," Governor Walker said. "This week, we highlight their achievements and encourage more entrepreneurs to take the leap and realize their visions. The great news is that in the last three years, more than 19,000 net new businesses have been established, which means they are hiring employees, and moving our economy forward."
This year, events are being hosted in San Francisco, Kansas City, Boston, and Washington D.C., with additional webinars hosted here. The U.S. Small Business Administration, which offers loans, loan guarantees, contracts, and counseling sessions to small businesses, was officially established in 1953, but its mission began years earlier in response to the Great Depression and economic effects of World War II.
