Governor Scott Walker signed seven bills related to mental health services today at Brown County Sophie Beaumont Building.
"Far too many Wisconsinites are in need of mental health care and because of circumstance or location, are unable to access the care they desperately need," Governor Walker said. "These bills, which I am proud to sign today, are a huge step forward in the cause to ensure every individual living with mental illness gets the care they need. I thank the members of the Legislature for their bipartisan work on these bills."
