Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 30, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker signed Senate Bill (SB) 315 into law, legislation that provides an opportunity for Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) to utilize some of the budget reforms enacted last year. The legislation also allows school districts to use law enforcement or juvenile court records to discipline a student under the school district's athletic code.
"Today I am joining with officials from MPS and the Milwaukee Teachers Union by signing this bill into law," said Governor Walker. "The bottom line is that this legislation will help improve education for MPS students. I would like to thank State Senator Luther Olson and State Representative Steve Kestell who authored the original bill, and the entire Legislature for delivering this bill to my desk."
