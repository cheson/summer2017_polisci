Governor Scott Walker today issued the following statement on the Assembly and Senate's passage of the expansion of the economic development tax credit with bipartisan support.
"Increasing the amount of economic development tax credits increases the opportunity we have to help businesses grow and create jobs," said Governor Scott Walker. "As Wisconsin opens for business these additional resources will help us reach our goal of freeing the private sector to create 250,000 new jobs. Thank you to Representatives Robin Vos, John Klenke and Mary Williams, Senators Alberta Darling, Mary Lazich and Terry Moulton and all of the legislature for working so hard to transform Wisconsin."
The legislation will increase the amount available for economic development tax credits from $75 million to $100 million.
