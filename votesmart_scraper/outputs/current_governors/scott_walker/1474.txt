Thank Volunteers One Month from Election Day
Scott and Tonette Walker and Mark and Sue Neumann today thanked volunteers and supporters at the Waukesha Victory Center exactly one month from Election Day.

"I'm happy to be with so many of our supporters and Scott's supporters who have joined together to turn our state around," said Neumann. "Sue and I will be doing everything we can to help Scott and Tonette for the next month, and we want to make sure that every vote that went for Mark Neumann will be cast in November for Scott. As a businessman, I know that it's critical we end the disastrous policies of the last eight years to get Wisconsin back to work. That is why I am standing with Scott today"

"I thank Mark and Sue for their continued support and dedication," said Walker. "We have a shared vision to get Wisconsin working again that relies on the people -- not the government -- to bring jobs to our state. Over the next month, I'll continue to travel the state bringing our plan to create 250,000 jobs to Wisconsin, and I thank Mark for his business perspective and creative plans for Wisconsin as we continue the campaign."
