Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
In the last few weeks, we've seen some good news for the people of Wisconsin.
First, after losing 134,000 jobs in the four years prior to 2011, actual jobs data show Wisconsin gained over 62,000 jobs in 2011-2012. This is great news for the people of our state because it means that 62,000 more moms, dads, and grandparents have jobs and are able to make ends meet. Whether it's increased wages, increased manufacturing jobs, increased revenue, or a lower unemployment rates, all economic indicators show Wisconsin is creating jobs. We're headed in the right direction, and I'll continue to place my focus on job creation every single day as your Governor.
In addition to the good news on jobs, the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau recently announced increased revenue projections which show Wisconsin having $500 million more than expected in the next budget. That's a tremendous turnaround from the $3.6 billion deficit of two years ago. Because of our sound fiscal management, we are now able to invest in our priorities. We should use our budget surplus and increased revenue projections to invest in aid for our schools, lower income taxes for middle-class families, and build our rainy day fund.
Wisconsin's economy is growing, and our tough, but prudent, decisions mean we are better off than we were two years ago. There is more work left to be done, but we're making progress, and together, we're moving Wisconsin forward.
