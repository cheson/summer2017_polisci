One of the most important duties I have serving as your Governor is to provide you directly with updates related to the operation of our state government. I also frequently provide updates on Facebook (Governor Scott Walker) and Twitter (@GovWalker). Please feel free to share this update with your family, friends, and others who may be interested in state government operations.
2013 BIO International Convention
On Tuesday, I joined Wisconsin bioscience companies and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) at the 2013 BIO International Convention in Chicago, the largest bioscience event in the world. The event gave us an opportunity to promote our bioscience community and demonstrate that Wisconsin is a place for growth and opportunity.
The Wisconsin pavilion was coordinated by BioForward, an association that represents many of Wisconsin's bioscience companies, universities, non-profits, service providers, and government agencies. Over 50 Wisconsin companies and associations represented our bioscience industry at the convention.
WEDC provided branding and logistical support for the pavilion, which used the "InWisconsin" brand created by WEDC in 2012 to highlight the economic advantages of the state. You can read more about the conference, here.
University of Wisconsin System Surplus
It is very concerning to learn the University of Wisconsin (UW) System has been running a surplus balance of this size, especially at a time when students, families, and lawmakers have continually heard from the UW System about the need for more money to offset "devastating cuts." At a minimum, on behalf of students and their families, I am asking legislative leaders to freeze tuition increases for two years for the entire UW System during their deliberations on the budget.
