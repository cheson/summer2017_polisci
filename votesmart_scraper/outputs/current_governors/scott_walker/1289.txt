I campaigned for office with the goal of helping the private sector create 250,000 new jobs by 2015. Over the 3 years before I took office Wisconsin saw net private sector job losses totaling 150,000. In 2011 we were able to turn that trend around and help create thousands of new jobs. This week I was pleased to announce that Kestrel Aircraft Company is moving their manufacturing and headquarters to Superior.
This relocation will be a huge boost to the Superior area specifically, and will help Wisconsin's overall economy. I was pleased we could collaborate with the local community to bring the company to Superior.
Two state agencies, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, partnered with local officials to bring Kestrel's expansion to Superior.
Kestrel isn't the first business to move their headquarters to Wisconsin. Last year, FatWallet, a company that was voted "One of the 50 Best Small and Medium Companies to Work for in America" by Great Places To WorkÂ® moved to Wisconsin after Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch cold-called their CEO and told him about the advantages of doing business in Wisconsin. Additionally, Catalyst Exhibits moved across our southern border into Pleasant Prairie after Illinois increased taxes on businesses.
Even with these announcements, we still have a lot of work to do to get our economy back on track. I am optimistic that we have built the foundation for success in Wisconsin--a financially sound state budget and pro-growth attitude in government. Working together we can put our state on a path to prosperity.
