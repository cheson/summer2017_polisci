Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 21, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker issued Executive Order #196 today declaring a State of Emergency in response to elevated wildfire conditions throughout Wisconsin.
"Our first priority is protecting the people of Wisconsin and this executive order helps us control existing wildfires and prevent new ones from starting," Governor Walker said. "With the Wisconsin National Guard, we'll have the resources we need to appropriately assist in potential wildfire response and recovery efforts."
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) requested wildfire suppression support from the Wisconsin National Guard due to abnormally dry conditions across the state. The National Weather Service indicates weather conditions conducive to wildfires are possible, including gusty winds, low relative humidity, dry fuels, and widespread drought conditions.
