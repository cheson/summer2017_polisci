Governor Scott Walker joined GenMet employees and students today at their Manufacturing Day celebration in Mequon. This celebration allows students from the community to tour GenMet's facilities and experience the different types of manufacturing jobs taking place on the production floor every day.
"The manufacturing industry is thriving here in Wisconsin, and there is no better time than Manufacturing Month to highlight GenMet and all of our manufacturing businesses," Governor Walker said. "Today, students are seeing first-hand all that the manufacturing industry has to offer. GenMet is creating this opportunity for students to get a taste of manufacturing, maybe even sparking an interest in some to pursue a family-supporting job in this high-demand field. Throughout Manufacturing Month, we will continue to highlight Wisconsin's excellent manufacturers that are a crucial part of Wisconsin's economy."
