Governor Walker Signs Bill to Fully Utilize Gates Hall
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 2, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Scott Walker signed SB 442, which calls for the renovation of Gates Hall, a facility at the Wisconsin Veterans Home in Union Grove.
"This upgrade will help increase access to skilled nursing facilities for Wisconsin Veterans," said Governor Walker. "Beyond providing additional skilled nurses, this bill will also ensure the future fiscal stability of our home at Union Grove. I am glad the Legislature delivered this proposal to my desk and would like to specifically thank Senator Wanggaard and Representative Vos for bringing this legislation forward and helping us meet the needs of more veterans."
Gates Hall is currently an assisted living facility, serving 42 veterans. SB 442 will provide for the conversion of Gates Hall to a 38-bed skilled nursing facility costing $4.9 million, 65% of which would be federally funded. The remaining cost would be covered by existing program revenue from the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs.
