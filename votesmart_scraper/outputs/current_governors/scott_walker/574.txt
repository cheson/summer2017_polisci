Hi, this is Scott Walker.
As we get ready to roll out our next state budget in less than two weeks, I want to take a little time to tell you about what we are doing help more people get jobs.
The first step is to identify the barriers that keep people from moving from government dependence to true independence. One of those barriers unfortunately is drug use, abuse, or addiction.
We are proposing a plan that will allow drug testing for people applying for, or accepting benefits through programs like unemployment, FoodShare, Medicaid, or several other assistance programs. In some high-demand fields, including manufacturing, many employers require drug testing of their employees.
Once we identify a problem, we can help. Those who fail a drug test will have the opportunity to get treatment -- free of charge -- as well as job training.
In addition, our 2-year budget extends our investment in Wisconsin Fast Forward -- as well as extending our increased investment in apprenticeships and ways to help people with disabilities who want to be a part of the workforce.
We are continuing our investment in the Transform Milwaukee Jobs Program, to further our work to grow jobs in Milwaukee, and extending that program to cities like Racine, Kenosha, as well as high need rural parts of the state.
Among other things, our budget proposal makes it easier for qualified persons to earn a teacher's license, and for qualified veterans to get a CDL. We'll continue our investments that help veterans start their own businesses and create jobs.
That's just part of our workforce readiness plan. Our goal is to help open the door for more people in Wisconsin to enjoy the freedom and prosperity that comes from having a great job, and doing it well.
