Press Release

Date: June 14, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

The trade mission to Mexico continued today as Governor Walker and the Wisconsin delegation met with company officials from Grupo Bimbo and from Quad/Graphics.
Grupo Bimbo is the largest baking company in the world, whose U.S. group owns three bakeries and 25 other sites in Wisconsin from Kenosha to Superior.
"Companies like Grupo Bimbo clearly recognize all Wisconsin has to offer," Governor Walker said. "We want to make sure they know we have tools to help them expand and grow in Wisconsin."
The purpose of the mission is to strengthen trade and investment ties between Wisconsin and Mexico. Mexico is Wisconsin's second-largest export destination with the state's exports to Mexico totaling nearly $3 billion in 2015.
Governor Walker and the delegation also toured the Quad/Graphics facility in Xochimilco, south of Mexico City. The Wisconsin-based printing company, founded in 1962 in Racine, is now headquartered in Sussex. The company has grown to become the second-largest print and integrated media solutions provider in the Western Hemisphere, according to the company's website.
"Quad/Graphics is a prime example of a homegrown Wisconsin business becoming a global leader," said Governor Walker. "We are tremendously proud of the growth they have seen and thank them for supporting jobs here, and back in Wisconsin."
