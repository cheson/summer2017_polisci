This week I announced my support for a package of education reforms that will be based on the work of three separate bipartisan taskforces. Every child deserves access to a great education. This reform package will improve accountability in our school system, improve teacher training, and lay the foundation for our children to succeed.
Read to Lead--The work done by this group will improve Wisconsin's long-stagnant reading achievement scores. The taskforce was comprised of reading teachers, researchers, advocates, Legislators from both parties, and others.
Educator Effectiveness--This taskforce is aimed at creating a fair and rigorous system for evaluating teachers and principals. It was comprised of representation from Superintendent Tony Evers, my office, teacher unions, school boards, school administrators, and others.
School Accountability--This taskforce was convened last summer to design an alternative to No Child Left Behind that focuses on setting high standards, requiring transparency, and measuring what matters to ensure all students are ready for college or career.
Improving our schools, measuring student achievement growth, and increasing accountability and transparency in education will help ensure Wisconsin students can succeed. While members of the working groups deserve credit for their recommendations, our work is not yet done. I encourage parents, teachers, school board members, and all community leaders to help implement reforms to give students access to an even better education.
