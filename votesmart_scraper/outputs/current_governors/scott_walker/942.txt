Governor Scott Walker attended the closing ceremony of the Nation of Patriots' Patriot Tour. The Nation of Patriots rides each year to honor and pay tribute to past, present, and fallen American service members.

The Nation of Patriots' Patriot Tour spans 100 days, 14,000 miles, and 48 states each year. Founded in Wisconsin in 2009, the tour's goal is to honor and thank our service members and veterans. Funds raised during the ride provide financial support to families of wounded veterans.
