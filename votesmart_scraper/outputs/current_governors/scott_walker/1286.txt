Today the State Senate passed Senate Bill (SB) 335, which allows school boards to grant a technical diploma to any student who has fulfilled traditional graduation requirements and also completed a course of study in a technical field or fields. Additionally the State Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business passed AB 426, which is aimed at streamlining the regulatory process for mining in Wisconsin.
"Mining is a vital part of Wisconsin's history, which is why a miner is prominently displayed on our state flag," said Governor Walker. "I believe we can balance the creation of thousands of jobs with environmental protections. I applaud the Assembly Committee for taking action today."
AB 426 passed the Assembly Committee today with a vote of 9-5.
Under SB 335 the Department of Public Instruction will create a list of recommended certifications recognized by state and national industry groups that districts could adopt. Students with a technical diploma will have earned real world skills that provide the direction and means to, upon graduation from high school or college, begin earning a family supporting wage in a field of their choosing.
"Allowing DPI to closely couple education, job training, and recommended certifications through a technical diploma process will help those immediately looking for jobs," said Governor Walker. "I am pleased a version of the bill introduced in the Back to Work Wisconsin Special Session is moving forward. I would like to thank State Senator Olson and Representative Radcliffe for their help in moving this legislation along."
SB 338 passed the Senate today on a voice vote.
