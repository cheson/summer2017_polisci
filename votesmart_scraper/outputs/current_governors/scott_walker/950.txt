Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement on the approval of the Menominee Tribe's proposed casino by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs:
Given the approval by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs for the proposed Menominee casino, we will move forward with evaluating this casino using the criteria previously laid out by my Administration. The three criteria are: no new net gaming, community support, and consensus among the 11 sovereign nations.
As I have discussed with tribal leaders and representatives during my regular quarterly meetings with all the tribes, we will move forward with a 60-day comment gathering period for the tribes following the federal government's approval. My administration will begin reaching out to tribal representatives ahead of the beginning of the comment period to ensure all the tribes have the opportunity to provide feedback.
