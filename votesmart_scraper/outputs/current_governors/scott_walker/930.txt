Statement

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker attended the Korean War 60th Anniversary today at the Milwaukee County War Memorial. The event is held to commemorate the 34,000 service members, including 729 from Wisconsin, who gave their lives on behalf of the nation during the Korean War. It is also a special opportunity to honor the roughly 40,000 living Wisconsin veterans of the Korean War, as well as their families.
"It was a privilege to meet and speak with so many of Wisconsin's brave veterans today," Governor Walker said. "We pause to observe the 60th Anniversary marking the end of the Korean War, a conflict that changed the lives of many Americans and Wisconsinites. While we reflect on the sacrifice of our service men and women, we must also bear in mind our obligation to them--to provide our troops and veterans with the resources they need and deserve."
Five Wisconsin veterans are among those being honored for their valor and selflessness in the Korean War, one from each branch of the military: LeRoy Schuff (Marines), Darrell Krenz (Army), Bill Sprout (Navy), Loretta Metoxen (Air Force), and Robert Reeners (Coast Guard).
"The sacrifice and resolve of these individuals, as well as all our service men and women, will never be forgotten," Governor Walker added.
