Governor Scott Walker Takes the Lead, Nations' Governors Join in Signing SNAP Welfare Letter to Congressional Leaders
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 12, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker, joined by the Governors of Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah, signed a letter addressed to Congressional leaders expressing support for legislation confirming states' rights to drug test Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients. Governor Walker released the following statement:
"Programs like SNAP typically require job training as a condition to receive benefits, and implementing drug-testing requirements as well makes it easier for recipients with substance abuse to move from government dependence to true independence. That's why we've put in place drug screening, testing, and treatment mechanisms to help SNAP recipients enter a job training program where they'll receive the valuable skills and knowledge they need to obtain a family-supporting job. The legislation authored by Congressman Robert Aderholt confirms states' rights to drug test SNAP recipients, and we look forward to working with him on this crucial issue and implementing this common-sense reform in Wisconsin."
