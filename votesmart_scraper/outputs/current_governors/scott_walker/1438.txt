Today Governor Scott Walker signed into law legislation giving tax relief to Wisconsin small businesses. It is the fifth special session bill Governor Walker has signed into law. The new law, passed with bipartisan support, gives tax relief to small businesses for each job they create.
"Thanks to Senator Moulton and Representatives Vos and Williams, our state is improving our jobs environment," said Walker. "We are encouraging businesses to create jobs and put Wisconsinites to work. I'm pleased that this legislation like so many of our other jobs bills passed with bipartisan support."
The legislation will give businesses a tax deduction for each job they create. The size of the deduction varies depending on the size of the business creating the jobs.
