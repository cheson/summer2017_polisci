Today Governor Walker signed Senate Bill (SB) 368, legislation that reforms Wisconsin's wetland regulations.
"Preserving and protecting Wisconsin's valuable natural resources while encouraging sustainable economic growth is an important task," said Governor Walker. "The bill I signed into law today balances these two interests and reforms the way the state regulates wetlands. I am confident this pro-growth, pro-environmental law will allow the state to protect our resources while providing a pathway to economic development. I would like to thank State Senator Neal Kedzie and Representative Jeff Mursau for providing leadership on this issue."
Wetland regulation reform was included in Governor Walker's Back to Work Wisconsin Special Session Call.
