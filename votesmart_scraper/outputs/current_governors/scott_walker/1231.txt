Today Governor signed legislation to expand access to Family Care. He signed Senate Bill 380, which that removes the caps on the Family Care program and allows it to be expanded with approval from the Joint Finance Committee. This bill received bipartisan support in both houses of the Legislature.
"Lifting the cap on Family Care will help provide care for Wisconsinites truly in need," said Governor Walker. "Helping citizens in need, while being financially responsible, is not a partisan issue. I am glad it moved through the Legislature. I would like to thank Representative Dean Kaufert and Senator Terry Moulton for their leadership on this legislation."
Last year a cap was placed on Family Care as the state looked for ways to implement improvements highlighted by the non-partisan Legislative Audit Bureau.
