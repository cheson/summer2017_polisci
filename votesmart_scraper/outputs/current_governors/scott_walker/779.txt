Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 4, 2014
Location: Vausau, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 338 today in the Town of Rib Mountain. This bill allows large, urban towns to establish Tax Incremental Finance (TIF) Districts, which is an effective economic development tool currently used by cities and villages.
"Encouraging new business development is key to growing our economy back on track and continuing down the road to greater prosperity," Governor Walker said. "Dozens of Wisconsin towns, including beautiful Rib Mountain, will benefit from the opportunity TIF Districts can offer. By working together to establish a pro-growth business environment, we help business leaders create jobs and foster Wisconsin's entrepreneurial spirit."
