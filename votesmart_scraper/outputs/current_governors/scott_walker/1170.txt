Wisconsin Troopers Association Reaffirms 2010 Endorsement of Governor Walker
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 25, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker received the endorsement of the Wisconsin Troopers Association [WTA] today for the upcoming recall election. The WTA, made up of troopers, inspectors, and police communication operators, endorsed Governor Walker in 2010 and reaffirms its endorsement today.
"Governor Walker has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to first responders and public safety throughout his career," said Ryan Zukowski, executive director of the Wisconsin Troopers Association. "The Wisconsin Troopers Association supported Governor Walker in 2010 to serve a full four-year term, and that endorsement stands firm today."
In response to the endorsement, Governor Walker said:
"I am honored to have the support of so many brave men and woman who put their lives on the line each day to keep Wisconsin's citizens safe. I have always made the needs of our first responders a top priority throughout my career in public service, and we must continue to protect those who protect us each day. Mayor Barrett has failed to provide Milwaukee's first responders with the resources they require and he would move Wisconsin backward on public safety."
In addition to the WTA's endorsement, Governor Walker has received the endorsements of the Milwaukee Police Association and the Milwaukee Professional Firefighters Association.
