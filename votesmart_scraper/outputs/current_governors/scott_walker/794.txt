Video Release: Governor Scott Walker's Blueprint for Prosperity Means More Tax Relief for Wisconsin
Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released a video today about the Blueprint for Prosperity tax relief plan, which he signed into law today, and the real savings Wisconsin families, farmers, and small business owners can expect.
Here are some excerpts from the video:
In January, we announced that Wisconsin has a budget surplus of nearly one billion dollars. Our plan for the surplus -- which we call the Blueprint for Prosperity -- is simple: return the money to the hardworking taxpayers because it's your money.
Today, that money -- more than $800 million dollars -- is on the way back in the form of property and income tax cuts, and adjustments to withholding.
Â…
And for a typical homeowner, your property tax bill this December will be 100 dollars lower than last year. In fact, the typical property tax bill will actually be lower in 2014 than it was in 2010 before I took office.
That's great, because we want more people to live the American Dream. Owning a house is a big part of that dream. Here in Wisconsin, one of the barriers to owning your own home has been high property taxes. Instead of the massive tax hikes we say in the past, property taxes are going down. My goal is to continue that relief so that property taxes on a typical home will be even lower in 2018.
