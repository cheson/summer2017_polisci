Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 9, 2015
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker is leading a weeklong trade mission to Germany, France, and Spain focusing on increasing the state's exports in those countries and encouraging European companies to invest in Wisconsin.
"Wisconsin hit an all-time record for exporting in 2014, and one aspect of our strategy to continue that growth is to provide state companies with opportunities to establish and develop new partnerships overseas," Governor Walker said. "At the same time, we will conduct one-on-one meetings with executives of companies in all three countries about the benefits of establishing or expanding their operations in Wisconsin."
Governor Walker will lead a 22-member delegation that includes leaders from Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), executives from seven Wisconsin companies, Jim Paetsch, Vice President of Corporate Expansion & Attraction for the Milwaukee 7 regional economic development organization, and Dean Amhaus, President and CEO of The Water Council.
During the trade mission, the company executives will engage in targeted, one-on-one meetings with potential business partners coordinated by WEDC's authorized trade representative network in those countries. Governor Walker and WEDC leaders will participate in meetings with European companies to discuss expansion or investment opportunities in Wisconsin.
