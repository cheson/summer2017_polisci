WHAT does Medicaid have in common with "I Dream of Jeannie," "Lost in Space" and "Get Smart"? They all made their debut in 1965. Although we enjoy watching reruns of these classics, the television networks have updated their programming. The federal government should do the same.
In recent years Washington has taken an obsolete program, which covers health care for low-income Americans, and made it worse through restrictive rule-making that defies common sense. It is biased toward caring for people in nursing homes rather than in their own homes and neighborhoods. It lacks the flexibility to help patients who require some nursing services, but not round-the-clock care.
If we were designing a health insurance program for low-income families today, we would use a much different model to drive efficiency and innovation -- one that recognizes that the delivery of health care is fundamentally personal and local.
Time and again states like Wisconsin have blazed the path in Medicaid -- from giving individuals greater control over their care to expanding the use of electronic medical records -- while the federal bureaucracy has lagged behind. Just now Washington is discovering accountable care organizations (networks of doctors and hospitals that share responsibility for caring for patients and receive incentives to keep costs down) and "medical homes" (a model in which one primary-care doctor takes the main responsibility for a patient).
Wisconsin has created a database of claims and payments that gathers information from all insurers, including private companies and the state Medicaid program. It allows people to compare cost and quality across providers. We have asked Washington to add its data to our database, but it has not done so.
