Governor Scott Walker issued Executive Order #179 yesterday creating the Governor's Commission on Government Reform, Efficiency, and Performance.

"Government programs and services should be continually reviewed and adjusted in order to make sure they are meeting the needs of the people and to maximize their performance. One of our top priorities is modernizing state government services to be more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the public.
