Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 6, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today addressed job creators at the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce Business Day in Madison. Governor Walker highlighted the state's improving economy and expressed his plans for future growth.
"Today, 95 percent of job creators feel our state is moving in "the right direction." In 2010, only 10 percent thought Wisconsin was moving forward," Governor Walker said. "The positive outlook is great news, but our work is not done. We will not let up until every person in this state who wants a job has a job."
Governor Walker announced his Blueprint for Prosperity plan during the 2014 State of the State address, following news of the state's $911 million surplus, created by a strong economic recovery and long-term structural reforms yielding results. Private sector job growth from April to November was the best in nearly 20 years.
