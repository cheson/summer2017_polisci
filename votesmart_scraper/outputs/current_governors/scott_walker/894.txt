Governor Scott Walker Calls Special Session to Address Failed Federal Rollout of the Affordable Care Act
Press Release

Governor Scott Walker today issued Executive Order #123 calling a special session of the Legislature to address the implications of the failed federal launch of the Affordable Care Act. The special session will begin on December 2.
"The federal government failed to get its website fully operational, and it is irresponsible to force some Wisconsinites to pay the price for the federal government's failure," Governor Walker said. "I'm calling a special session of the Legislature to approve our plan extending the deadline for individuals moving to the federal exchange. We need to give people more time."
Last week, Governor Walker laid out a plan for a three-month delay in the implementation of people moving into health care plans in the federal exchange. A three-month extension of the Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan (HIRSP) was also announced in order to provide a safety net during the transition for some of the state's most vulnerable residents.
At the same time, Governor Walker called on President Barack Obama's Administration to allow Wisconsinites, who qualify for subsidies, to use their subsidies to purchase any qualified health plan. This will provide more insurance provider options because in many counties people will have more options outside of the exchange than they do on it.
