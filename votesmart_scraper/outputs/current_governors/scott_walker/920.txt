Location: Madison, WI

The Department of Administration State Controller's Office today released its Annual Fiscal Report showing a surplus of $759.2 million as of the end of the fiscal year. This is $274.5 million higher than the balance of $484.7 million projected in the January 24, 2013 re-estimates from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. This results in a deposit of $153.2 million into the state's rainy day fund, for a total of $278.5 million. In reaction, Governor Scott Walker released the following statement:
When we took office two years ago, we said we would be good stewards of the taxpayers' money, and this report shows we're on the right track. Our tough, but prudent, decisions are paying off for Wisconsin families. In just over two years, we've turned a $3.6 billion budget deficit into a nearly $760 million surplus. Our latest deposit of $153 million into the state's rainy day fund is the largest in state history, and the $278 million balance of the fund is also the largest ever. This is more great news for the hardworking taxpayers, but there's more work left to be done.
