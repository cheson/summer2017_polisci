Hi, Scott Walker here.
Strong, stable families are the core foundation of Wisconsin's society.
This week we created the Future of the Family Commission to ensure Wisconsin families are finding the support, guidance, and resources they need to thrive in our state.
To start, the commission will evaluate the status of Wisconsin families. This will include trends in household and family structures, as well as how public policy impacts these trends.
Members of the commission will spend time researching how family structure affects their social and economic success in Wisconsin.
Finally, they will work to identify which programs are efficiently working for our families in Wisconsin.
The commission members will use their diverse backgrounds to determine new ways to strengthen and support Wisconsin families as they work towards living their piece of the American Dream.
The commission will then recommend ways in which public policy can better support and strengthen families to achieve their social and economic success goals.
On Wednesday, the commission met for the first time, and at the end of the year we will receive their report. We look forward to hearing about their findings and suggestions as we continue to support Wisconsin families throughout this great state.
