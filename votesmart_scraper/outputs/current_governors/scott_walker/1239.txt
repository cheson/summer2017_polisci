Today the legislature gave final passage to SB 380. This legislation would lift the caps and allow for the expansion of Family Care.
"This legislation will provide care for Wisconsinites truly in need," said Governor Walker. "Lifting the caps on Family Care and being fiscally responsible earned this bill great bipartisan support. I would like to thank Representative Dean Kaufert and Senator Terry Moulton for their leadership on this legislation."
