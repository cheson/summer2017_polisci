Governor Scott Walker Participates in Read Across America
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 28, 2014
Location: Sparta, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker joined students as a guest reader at St. Patrick's School in Sparta, as part of Read Across America Day Celebration. Governor Walker read the Dr. Seuss book, "Oh! The Places You'll Go."
"Literacy is the skill that provides the foundation for education," Governor Walker said. "We are committed to making sure kids know how to read before they reach fourth grade, when they need to read to learn other subjects. My Read to Lead initiative promotes literacy through early screenings, teacher development, and investments for effective programs helping make sure every child is on track to a successful future built on a great education."
Read Across America is a national campaign bringing together schools, libraries, and communities to promote reading for children and teens. The event occurs each year in conjunction with the birthday of famous child author, Theodor "Seuss" Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss.
In 2011, Governor Walker launched his Read to Lead initiative, a comprehensive effort to support and expand literacy programs throughout the state, so every fourth grade student is no longer learning to read, but reading to learn. The initiative includes programs assessing basic literacy skills of students from kindergarten through second grade and strengthening literacy requirements for teacher preparation training.
The Read to Lead Council partners with Wisconsin companies and community groups to promote reading and literacy. Through the Read to Lead Development Fund, the Council funds worthy projects to improve literacy and serve as a model to improve the reading achievement of Wisconsin students and adults. The council is currently receiving applications.
