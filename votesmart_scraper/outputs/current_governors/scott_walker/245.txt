Statement

Location: Osceola, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed legislation into at J & S General Contracting relating to rights of real property and clarifies zoning regulations for property owners.
"Municipalities in Wisconsin must notify our citizens if a zoning change is going to affect the use of their property," Governor Walker said. "This bill clarifies zoning regulations, and makes additional changes to protect the property owners in our state."
Assembly Bill 582, now Act 391, prohibits local governments from requiring a person to take certain actions regarding real property to pay a related fee before purchasing, taking title to, or occupying the property. The bill was authored by Representative Adam Jarchow (R-Balsam Lake) and Senator Frank Lasee (R-De Pere).
The bill also forbids a city, village, town, or county from prohibiting or unreasonably restricting the sale or transfer of title to any interest in real property; requires political subdivisions to provide a method for landowners to receive written notice of potential action that may affect the allowable use of the landowner's property; provides that a setback line from the ordinary high-water mark established by a professional land surveyor may be legally relied upon for the purposes of development near a water body; makes changes to shoreland zoning laws related to runoff control structures and utility equipment; and requires an economic impact analysis of a proposed administrative rule to include an analysis of the ways in which and the extent to which the proposed rule would place any limitations on the free use of private property.
"This legislation not only protects Wisconsin property owners, it also helps create an environment where people want to live and raise a family, which ultimately bolsters our economy and job creation," Governor Walker added.
