Today, Governor Scott Walker visited Chippewa Valley Technical College in Eau Claire as a part of his Working for Wisconsin tour. The Working for Wisconsin tour highlights initiatives and programs that are working for the people of Wisconsin. Governor Walker's visit to Chippewa Valley Technical College focuses on promoting educational resources such as their Applied Technology Center as a means to improve Wisconsin's workforce.
"Technical college students fill a crucial need for job creators as they look for skilled workers for open positions in their workforce," Governor Walker said. "As we continue to bridge the skills gap here in Wisconsin, it is vital that we invest in our students, and equip them with the resources and knowledge they need to thrive in high-demand fields, such as manufacturing and energy. The Applied Technology Center and the new Energy Education Center at Chippewa Valley Technical College are both excellent resources that allow students hands-on experience and training, making them better prepared to obtain a family-supporting jobs upon graduation."
