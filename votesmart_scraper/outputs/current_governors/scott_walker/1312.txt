"We trust teachers, counselors and administrators to provide our children world-class instruction, to motivate them and to keep them safe. In the vast majority of cases, education professionals are succeeding, but allowing some schools to fail means too many students being left behind. By ensuring students are learning a year's worth of knowledge during each school year and giving schools the freedom to succeed, Wisconsin will once again become a model for the nation."
--Scott Walker
For years, Wisconsin had the distinction of being a national leader in educational reform. From the groundbreaking Milwaukee Parental Choice Program to policies aimed at expanding the role of charter schools in communities across the state, Wisconsin was viewed as a pioneer in educational innovation and creativity.
Wisconsin used to rank 3rd in fourth grade reading, now we're in the middle of the pack at best with some of the worst achievement gaps in the nation.
Fortunately, Wisconsin has turned a corner and is once again becoming a leader in educational excellence by refocusing on success in the classroom. This has been done by pinpointing the following simple but effective reforms:
*Improving transparency
*Improving accountability
*Creating choice
We are working to restore Wisconsin's rightful place as an education leader. Our students, our teachers, and our state's future depend on our continued implementation of reform.
