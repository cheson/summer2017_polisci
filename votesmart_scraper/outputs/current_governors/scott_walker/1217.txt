Governor Walker Signs Concussion Safety Bill at Lambeau Field
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 2, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

At Lambeau Field in Green Bay today, Governor Scott Walker signed bipartisan legislation into law that is aimed at protecting children from critical injuries stemming from multiple concussions.
Assembly Bill (AB) 259 affects athletes under the age of 19 that are involved in organized sports. Under the new law, players that suffer a possible concussion are not allowed to return to play until they are cleared by a health care professional trained in concussion evaluation and management.
"We often hear about the effects of concussions on pro-athletes, like those that play here at Lambeau Field," Governor Walker said. "And the reality is that it takes even longer for younger athletes to recover from this type of brain injury. If they suffer a second or third concussion before they have had time to heal properly the damages can be irreparable. The goal of this bill is to greatly lessen the risk of long-term injury or death."
AB 259 has been dubbed the Sidelined for Safety Act, which also promotes education by requiring coaches and parents of athletes to read and sign information about the dangers of concussions.
With this bill, Wisconsin becomes the 32nd state to have a Sidelined for Safety law.
Packer President Mark Murphy and Former Packer Mark Tauscher joined Governor Walker in speaking in support of the new law. Governor Walker thanked Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) and Rep. Jason Fields (D-Milwaukee) for their work on the legislation, who were also in attendance
