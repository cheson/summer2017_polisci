Governor Scott Walker attended the National Agriculture Day event at Southwest Technical College (STC) today in Fennimore. National Ag Day, sponsored by the Agriculture Council of America, recognizes the important contributions made by the agriculture industry in Wisconsin, as well as nationwide.
"Agriculture is a vital industry in Wisconsin's economy, and we are very fortunate to have strong partnerships between our state's technical college system and the agricultural community," Governor Walker said. "We are also phasing in the Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit to allow job creators in this industry to grow and expand and invest in their operations."
Governor Walker signed legislation creating the Manufacturing and Agriculture Tax Credit in 2011. This credit took effect in tax year 2013, and increases in four steps to 7.5 percent in tax year 2016 and beyond. This credit makes Wisconsin a more competitive place to grow manufacturing and agriculture businesses and jobs.
Under his Blueprint for Prosperity plan, Governor Walker recently signed into law an additional $35.4 million in increased funding for the Wisconsin Fast Forward program. This latest investment will help to eliminate technical college waiting lists for high demand fields, including manufacturing, agriculture, and Information Technology.
Southwest Technical College has several programs targeted towards agriculture, including the Agribusiness/Science Technology Program, Farm Business and Production Management, the Agricultural Power and Equipment Technician Program, and Dairy Herd Management.
