Governor Walker Encourages Farmers Impacted by Recent Frost to Contact FSA
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker is encouraging farmers whose crops were damaged by last week's frost to report losses to their Farm Service Agency (FSA) county office.
"Our administration is working closely with the FSA to ensure Wisconsin farmers are protected from significant crop loss," Governor Walker said. "Apple orchards and vineyards have been hit especially hard, and we urge all farmers affected by the frost to contact their local FSA office. By reporting crop damage, Wisconsin farmers are taking the necessary steps to ensure they are financially secure."
Crop damage information reported to local FSA offices may be used to request a U.S. Department of Agriculture disaster declaration, which could result in low-cost emergency loans and other financial assistance for Wisconsin farmers.
