Location: Madison, WA

Today the Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council (UIAC) voted unanimously to recommend Rep. Mark Honadel's (R-South Milwaukee) and Senator Van Wanggaard's (R-Racine) Wisconsin Wins legislation, a component of Governor Walker's Wisconsin Working plan. This legislation would allow Wisconsinites receiving unemployment to take part-time training jobs with employers potentially leading to full-time employment and allowing current job seekers to receive training and demonstrate their skills for potential employers.
"Representative Honadel and Senator Wanggaard put forward important legislation to improve workforce training," said Governor Walker. "I am pleased that the UIAC, including labor leaders and management, unanimously endorsed Wisconsin Wins. This legislation is the right thing to do for Wisconsin workers."
