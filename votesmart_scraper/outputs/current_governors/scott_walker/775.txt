Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 8, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker attended the Statewide Value Committee (SVC) meeting to discuss improving health care in Wisconsin. SVC gathers data and creates consensus on measures to make health care sound and functional for providers, purchasers, employers, and payers. At the meeting, Governor Walker outlined his priorities for health care and his recommendations moving into the future.
"The Statewide Value Committee has worked diligently to gather input from all parties and has developed the basis for the Wisconsin Health Report Card," Governor Walker said. "Wisconsin consumers will benefit greatly from knowing more about the quality and cost measures relating to their health care. I look forward to continuing the discussion on how to improve health care in Wisconsin."
Founded in November 2011, the Statewide Value Committee works to assist in accelerating the improvement of the health care system and unification of reporting measures to the public. The Committee works closely with representatives from Department of Health Services, Wisconsin's Medicaid Agency, and the Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds to maximize effectiveness and efficiencies. The collaborative efforts of these and many other groups will remain important as the state strives to deliver efficient healthcare.
