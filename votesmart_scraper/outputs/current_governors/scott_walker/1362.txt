Location: Siren, WI

Governor Scott Walker, joined by Wisconsin Emergency Management and other state and local officials, surveyed and assessed damage caused by a powerful storm in Northwest Wisconsin on July 1, 2011. Following the survey, Governor Walker met with state and local officials to discuss options for state assistance regarding residual timber removal and utilization.
"The amount of damaged timber that this storm left behind has raised a serious obstacle for local officials in their clean-up efforts," Governor Walker said. "With the potential for wildfires and other risks to public safety, the dangers posed by fallen timber have not been taken lightly and the State is taking action to prevent those dangers."
The Governor's Office and the Department of Natural Resources are working closely with other state agencies and local governments to stage an effective clean-up and removal effort of the 130,000 acres affected by the July 1 storm.
Maps of the affected area, provided by the Department of Natural Resources, are linked below.
