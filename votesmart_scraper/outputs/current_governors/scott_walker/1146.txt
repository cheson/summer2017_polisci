Each e-update, I will answer a question submitted by a recipient of the previous e-update or from someone who contacts my office directly.
Question: "What can we do about universities in Wisconsin which have become unaffordable without huge loans?"
Answer: That's a good question and an ongoing challenge here in Wisconsin and across the country.
Recently, I was proud to announce, along with the support of top University officials, the new UW Flexible Degree Program that could begin offering some courses as early as this fall. This revolutionary online program has the potential to drastically lower tuition costs to students, basically allowing them to earn college credit for skills and knowledge they already have. Under this program, students may also be able to take advantage of free courses available online from a variety of sources, and prove their competency and knowledge through rigorous evaluations and testing under the UW Flexible Degree Program. This will help the hundreds of thousands of busy Wisconsin adults, who have some college credit but no degree, gain access to a high quality UW degree. It will help us bring together employers and skilled workers in fields like health care, IT, and more by bridging the skills gap. I'm proud of the collaboration with and effort from UW-Extension and UW System to make this happen.
It has been a pleasure communicating with you. It is an honor to serve as your Governor and represent the residents of Wisconsin.
Sincerely,
Governor Scott Walker
