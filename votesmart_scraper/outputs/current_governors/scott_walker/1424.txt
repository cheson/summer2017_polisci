Collective Bargaining is a Fiscal Issue: Part 2
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Feb. 22, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker's office released more specific examples to show how collective bargaining fiscally impacts government.
Example #1 Paid-Time Off for Union Activities
In Milwaukee County alone, because the union collectively bargained for paid time off, fourteen employees receive salary and benefits for doing union business. Of the fourteen, three are on full-time release for union business. Milwaukee County spent over $170,000 in salary alone for these employees to only participate in union activities such as collective bargaining.
Example #2 Surrender of Management Rights
Because of collecting bargaining, unions have included provisions in employee contracts that have a direct fiscal impact such as not allowing management to schedule workers based on operational needs and requiring notice and approval by the union prior to scheduling changes. As county executive, Walker attempted to reduce work hours based on budget pressures and workload requirements by instituting a 35-hour work week to avoid layoffs, which the union opposed. Additionally, government cannot explore privatization of functions that could save taxpayers money.
Along with this release Governor Walker's spokesman, Cullen Werwie, released the following statement:
Unfortunately for the millions of taxpayers who are currently paying these Senators' salaries and benefits, Senator Julie Lassa and her 13 colleagues decided to take a 6 day vacation to Illinois to get "to know a lot of my fellow caucus members.'
While Senate Democrats are getting acquainted with each other in another state, Governor Walker is in Wisconsin working to balance the state budget. Senators should return to Wisconsin and make their voice heard through the democratic process by casting their votes.
