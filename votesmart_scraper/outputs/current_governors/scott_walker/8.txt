Press Release

Location: Holmen, Wi

Governor Scott Walker visited Sand Lake Elementary School in Holmen today to highlight the crucial funding provided to K-12 and rural schools under his budget proposal.
"Investing in student success is a top priority for us moving forward," Governor Walker said. "Our budget proposal invests more than $11.5 billion into public education -- all without raising property taxes on the hard-working taxpayers of our state. We're also focused on addressing some of the unique needs rural schools in Wisconsin face by providing additional assistance, including Sparsity Aid."
The Holmen School District is estimated to receive $66.7 million in funding from the state under Governor Walker's biennial budget, including:
An increase of more than $2.4 million in Per Pupil Aid. Governor Walker's budget proposal increases per-pupil funding by $200 per pupil in Fiscal Year 2018 and $204 per pupil in Fiscal Year 2019 -- the largest increase since the 2005-2007 biennium.
Governor Walker also highlighted his investments in La Crosse area rural schools, which would receive over $1.6 million more under his increases in Sparsity Aid.
