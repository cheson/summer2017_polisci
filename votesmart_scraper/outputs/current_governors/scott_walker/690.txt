Governor Walker today attended EAA AirVenture event in Oshkosh. Dubbed "The World's Greatest Aviation Celebration," it attracts fans of all things aviation from around the globe. This year's event takes place July 28-August 3.
"EAA AirVenture is a premiere aviation event," Governor Walker said. "More than 500,000 aviation enthusiasts are drawn to this event every year, making it unique and unparalleled in size and scope. Aviation plays a pivotal role in Wisconsin's economy with the total economic impact of the aviation industry reaching $7 billion and providing approximately 90,000 jobs throughout the state. This week-long event alone boosts the local and state economy by approximately $110 million."
This year's EAA AirVenture event will feature its first-ever full air show performance by the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds as part of the daily afternoon air shows Friday through Sunday, August 1-3. World War II aircraft and pyrotechnics are also featured throughout the week. Making an appearance for the first time at EAA AirVenture is NASA's Martin/General Dynamics WB-57F high-altitude aircraft, which provides airborne platforms at up to 70,000 feet to U.S. government agencies and other customers for scientific research, advanced technology development, and testing.
The Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) was founded in Milwaukee in 1953 by a group of individuals interested in aviation and in building their own airplanes. The organization has expanded to include recreational pilots, builders, and restorers. Formerly based in Franklin, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois, EAA moved to Oshkosh in 1969, where the EAA Museum also opened in 1983.
