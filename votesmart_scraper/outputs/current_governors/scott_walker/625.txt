Governor Scott Walker released the following video message today, about "Working Together to Move Wisconsin Forward."
A full transcript is below:
Hi everyone, Scott Walker here.
I just wanted to take a minute and talk about the positive path ahead of us as we continue our work together to build a better Wisconsin not only for today, but for the next generation.
We're already working hard on the next state budget -- and again we're starting in a much better position than we were back when I was first elected -- We had to tackle a 3-point-6 billion dollar deficit.
Because of our reforms, and our efficient use of your dollars -- the taxpayers dollars - we can focus on investing in what's important.
That means we'll continue our work to create more good-paying, family-supporting jobs.
We'll ensure people have the opportunity to learn the skills that people need to get those high-demand, high-paying jobs.
We'll help people move from government dependence to true independence.
And we will build on the progress we've made -- in lowering the tax burden, so the hard-working taxpayers of the state get to keep more of your hard-earned own money.
I'm proud of all we have accomplished, but we're not done yet -- Not even close!
The goal of the work we do here is simple -- We want EVERYONE to have the opportunity to achieve your piece of the American dream -- and live happy, healthy, prosperous lives in this great state.
Thank You for working with us to build a better Wisconsin.
