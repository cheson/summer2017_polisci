Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks today at the Nation of Patriots' Patriot Tour Homecoming Ceremony in Beaver Dam. The Patriot Tour is a journey, which spans 100 days and covers 48 states, taking place every year starting Memorial Day weekend and concluding Labor Day weekend. This trip across the nation is in honor and remembrance of our past, present, and fallen American service members.
"The courageous men and women who serve our country warrant our sincere respect and gratitude," Governor Walker said. "They've sacrificed their time, talents, and in some cases, have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom with their lives. We honor these selfless individuals every day, and the Nation of Patriots' Patriot Tour is an excellent event throughout the country that demonstrates our pride, thanks, and support for our military and veterans."
An independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, The Nation of Patriots was founded in 2009 by Bill Sherer in order to raise awareness and provide financial support for individuals who served in U.S. Armed Forces as well as their families. All donations received are given directly to veterans. In addition to providing financial support, The Nation of Patriots strives to raise awareness for the emotional, physical, and economic challenges that wounded veterans and their loved ones face.
