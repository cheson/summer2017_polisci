Hi, this is Scott Walker.
Like many parents across Wisconsin, Tonette and I are excited to see our two sons head back to school. While our two sons have always attended public schools in Wisconsin, this year is a major milestone for us as parents--our oldest son will be heading off to college. This achievement couldn't have been done without the hard work and dedication of outstanding teachers, hardworking school board members and school administrators, and a community that values quality education.
Tonette and I are grateful for the work done to educate our sons and all children across Wisconsin.
As the 2012-13 school year begins, I will continue to collaborate with educators and work with with Superintendent Evers to improve education in our state.
