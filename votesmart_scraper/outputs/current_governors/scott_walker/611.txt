Today, Moody's Investors Service announced it was changing the State of Wisconsin's bond rating outlook to positive. Prior to today's report, Moody's outlook for Wisconsin was stable.
"The independent analysis released today by Moody's shows that our strong fiscal management has put Wisconsin on a positive path," said Governor Scott Walker. "The tough decisions we made in the past have allowed us to look forward at new, innovative ways to cut taxes, grow our economy, and help the private sector create jobs."
According to Moody's report:
-The states Aa2 general obligation rating incorporates as a fully funded pension system and limited OPEB liability, moderate economic growth
-The rating also acknowledges the current 2013-2015 biennium budget does not include any fund transfers or debt restructuring to balance the budget, actions the state relied heavily on in the past
-As the state reduced its reliance on non-recurring budget solutions and began to fund its budget stabilization fund, which currently holds a modest $279 million the result has been an improving balance sheet.
-The positive outlook reflects improvements in the state's liquidity and financial position that, if continued, would allow the state to improve its reserves and draw closer to structural balance. The state's ability to make progress toward structural budget balance and continued improvement in its fund balances will be important to future credit analysis.
