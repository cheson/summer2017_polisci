Date: June 6, 2014
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker issued a proclamation today commemorating the 70th anniversary of the World War II Normandy invasion, commonly referred to as "D-Day", which marked the beginning of the end of the war in Europe. Approximately 320,000 men and 9,000 women from Wisconsin served in the armed forces during World War II and 8,390 Wisconsinites gave the ultimate sacrifice.
"Today, we remember the monumental courage, devotion, and skill displayed by those who stormed the beaches of Normandy 70 years ago to fight for the end of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed people of Europe and guarantee our security and freedom," Governor Walker said. "D-Day significantly changed the course of the war, and we will never forget those who were lost on that historic day. We remember those who died and honor all who served."
