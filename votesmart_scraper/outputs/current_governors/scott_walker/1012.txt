Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 2, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker today announced the new membership of his administration's Council on Workforce Investment, an advisory panel that will help guide efforts to advance the Governor's comprehensive agenda to prepare workers to find jobs in the modern workforce.
"As we look to target substantial investments to develop the workforce and help Wisconsinites successfully pursue family-supporting careers and find true independence, the Council on Workforce Investment will provide valuable input with representatives from business, education, legislative and other key groups," Governor Walker said. "My administration's continued focus on creating jobs will guide the work of the Council as we look to address the skills gap and fill employers' current and future labor market needs."
The Council is a federally-mandated body that advises the Governor and state Department of Workforce Development (DWD) on the allocation of federal workforce development funding. Among the duties of the Council are approving the annual Workforce Investment Act plan required of all states in coordination with Wisconsin's 12 autonomous workforce investment boards.
Mary Isbister, President of General Metalworks Corporation in Mequon, will serve as chair of the Governor's Council on Workforce Investment. Isbister also serves on the board of a number of regional and national organizations, including the Wisconsin Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Milwaukee Metropolitan Association of Commerce. She also previously served as the vice chair of the Council on Workforce Investment.
Mike Laszkiewicz, Vice President and General Manager of Power Controls at Rockwell Automation will serve as Vice Chair of the Council. Laszkiewicz currently serves as the chair of the Manufacturing Council, which advises the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce on issues related to manufacturing in the United States.
The membership of the council includes state legislators, local elected officials, and representatives from youth organizations, organized labor, and community-based organizations.
Governor Walker has proposed nearly $100 million in state funding to support a sweeping workforce development agenda, including a series of 2013-15 budget proposals as well as the recently enacted Wisconsin Fast Forward initiative, which targets $15 million in worker training funds and supports the development of a state-of-the-art labor market information system.
The new Council is expected to convene in May. A list of members is available at http://www.wi-cwi.org.
