Governor Walker Seeks Federal Damage Assessment for Flood Damage
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 18, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker requested the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct a preliminary damage assessment following torrential rains that caused more than $28 million in damage to roads and bridges in northern Wisconsin.
"Communities throughout northern Wisconsin were hit hard by flooding last week. We are doing everything we can to help them," said Governor Walker. "I saw the damage firsthand and have worked with Wisconsin's federal delegation and my cabinet to provide immediate assistance to the affected communities."
Governor Walker issued a State of Emergency last week for Ashland, Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, Iron, Price, Sawyer, and Washburn counties. Representatives from the Department of Administration (DOA), Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Department of Transportation (DOT), Public Service Commission (PSC), and Wisconsin Emergency Management (WEM) met with community members on Friday in Ashland. FEMA officials will look at damage to public infrastructure in those counties along with the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians and the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.
Local and tribal officials have estimated in excess of $28 million in debris clearance, emergency protective measures, and damage to roads and other public infrastructure.
FEMA teams will begin assessing damage the week of July 25, 2016. The assessment is expected to take a few days to complete. Information gathered will be provided to Governor Walker to help determine if the state will request a federal disaster declaration. It is the first step to request federal disaster assistance.
