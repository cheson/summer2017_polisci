Today, in light of recent projections showing the University of Wisconsin System will continue to carry a surplus of more than $1 billion, Governor Scott Walker is calling for an additional two-year tuition freeze for the UW System in the next budget. Governor Walker's most recent 2013-15 Budget froze tuition for two years, the first two-year tuition freeze in UW System history.
"After years of tuition hikes, it is important to give our students and their families a break. Our proposed second two-year tuition freeze will go a long way to helping working families and students have access to higher education," said Governor Walker. "This freeze continues our commitment from the last budget to make college more affordable for working families and students across our state."
