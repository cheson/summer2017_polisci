Hi, this is Scott Walker.
When I was growing up, my parents ingrained in me the idea that anyone who worked hard could go as far as their dreams would take them. It was through them that I got my first glimpse of the American Dream.
But some these days feel that dream has become out of reach for them and their families. With that in mind, this week I introduced our Freedom and Prosperity budget proposal. Our plan works to restore the American Dream right here in Wisconsin by focusing on our priorities.
As you know, one of our top priorities is lowering the property tax burden on the hardworking taxpayers across the state. Largely because of our reforms and the flexibility we gave to local governments, property taxes on a typical home in Wisconsin are now $131 less than they were in 2010.
I am proud to say that our state budget will continue those reforms, so the property tax bill on a typical home will be even lower during the next two years. Just as I promised, property taxes by the end of 2016 will be lower than they were in 2014.
Under our plan, Wisconsin's hard-working families will get relief on their property tax bills for six years in a row. Now that's good news.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week.
