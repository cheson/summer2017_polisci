One of the most important duties I have serving as your Governor is to provide you directly with updates related to the operation of our state government. I also frequently provide updates on Facebook (Governor Scott Walker) and Twitter (@GovWalker). Please feel free to share this update with your family, friends, and others who may be interested in state government operations.
Wisconsin Walleye Initiative Announced
Fishing is such an important part of Wisconsin's sporting heritage, and the demand for walleye continues to increase. With this historic investment, we are making long-term improvements to Wisconsin's lakes and our state's fishing and tourism industries. I thank Senator Joe Leibham (R-Sheboygan) and Representative Dan LeMahieu (R-Cascade) for their work on this initiative.
The Wisconsin Walleye Initiative includes the following:
· $8.2 million in existing unencumbered bonding authority to expand hatchery capacities.
· $1.8 million for operating costs over the biennium.
· $2 million over the biennium for a competitive grant program for private organizations to expand walleye production and to cover operational costs.
· $160,000 in one-time funds for the UW-Extension to continue their work with private aquaculture through the end of fiscal year 2014.
· $500,000 annually beginning in fiscal year 2015 to contract with organizations to acquire additional walleye fingerlings.
· $250,000 annually to expand the summer Tribal Youth Program. The program is a state-tribal partnership giving high school-aged tribal youth the opportunity to work on natural resource-related projects.
