Location: Milwaukee, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined the Blinded Veterans Association this morning at their 71st National Convention in Milwaukee. The Blinded Veterans Association (BVA), with 8,500 members, including 153 in Wisconsin, is recognized as the exclusive voice for blinded veterans and their families nationwide.
"Our men and women in uniform sacrifice every day to protect the freedom of our nation," Governor Walker said. "The meaning of that sacrifice is known all too well by our veterans and their families. Today, we thank them for their courage, selflessness, and willingness to fight for our nation. We also recognize the Blinded Veterans Association for their leadership and advocacy for our blinded veterans."
BVA was founded after World War II by around 100 young men who had recently lost their sight in the war and were recovering from their injuries together at a convalescent hospital near Avon, Connecticut. In 1945, the group held a meeting to form their organization and in 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law an Act of the 85th Congress that formally incorporated BVA.
The Wisconsin District of the Blinded Veterans Association includes 153 active members who meet four times every year. They focus on peer to peer counseling and mutual aid. They also organize social activities for BVA members with the help of a nonprofit called Visually Impaired Veterans Activity (VIVA).
Governor Walker also proclaimed today as Blinded Veterans Association Day. A copy of the proclamation is attached.
