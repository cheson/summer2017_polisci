Hi, Scott Walker here.
As we continue to move Wisconsin forward, we've asked to hear from you -- our hard-working taxpayers -- about where you think our state should be heading in the next two decades.
In more than 30 listening sessions throughout the state, we've engaged in open discussions with more than 1,000 Wisconsin citizens from various walks of life about what we're doing right and where we can improve.
Based on our conversations, the most frequently discussed topics so far have been K-12 education, jobs, and general quality of life issues facing our communities, such as job training initiatives, access to broadband, and workforce retention.
Just this week we're holding listening sessions in Baldwin, Elmwood, and Marshall, and our goal is to visit every county in Wisconsin. It's so invigorating for us to get out around the state and talk to people about what matters most to them and their families.
We look forward to holding more listening sessions over the next several months, and the input we receive from these sessions will guide us as we approach our next state budget and legislative session.
