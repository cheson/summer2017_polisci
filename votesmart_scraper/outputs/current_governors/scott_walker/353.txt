Governor Scott Walker joined the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) today in announcing $1.5 million in Broadband Expansion Grants. Governor Walker and PSC Chair Ellen Nowak announced a $99,000 grant for Amery Telcom, Inc. at Clayton High School in Clayton and a $41,914 grant for GogebicRange.net at the Iron County Courthouse in Hurley. These grants, which are a part of the Broadband Expansion Grant Program, help to drive businesses, non-profits, and local governments to invest in broadband, which benefits thousands of Wisconsinites across the state.
"In our modern world, it is necessary for our state's businesses, schools, and households to have access to fast and reliable broadband internet," Governor Walker said. "These Broadband Expansion Grants help make it easier for employers to find the workers they need to fill their open positions, encourages our businesses to grow and thrive, and improves the quality of education for Wisconsin's students. Improving internet access opens the door to infinite resources for our business leaders, teachers, students and residents, and helps to build a stronger Wisconsin."
