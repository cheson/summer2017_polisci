Wisconsin Department of Health Services Secretary Kitty Rhoades passed away today after falling ill this past week surrounded by her family in Madison.
Governor Scott Walker released a statement today regarding her passing.

Our hearts ache because of the passing of Kitty. Tonette and I grieve with her husband Frank and their family. Kitty's passing will be felt by the many people she engaged with throughout her life and will be especially felt in the Hudson, Wisconsin community, where her family has deep roots and to which Kitty built her career in public service around. She was a vital part of our administration, a former colleague, and a dear friend.

Kitty had the chance to do what she loved - serving and leading the people of Wisconsin on health care issues. Her passion for public policy through her time serving as a business and community leader in Hudson, as a Wisconsin State Representative for 12 years, and then as Secretary of the Department of Health Services, was evident to all those who worked with her. It was an honor to serve with her.

Kitty's dedication and service to the state have changed Wisconsin for the better, and she leaves behind a long list of accomplishments as her legacy. She also leaves behind many friends in my administration, who admired her tenacity, spirit, and leadership. We will miss all that she offered to us on behalf of Wisconsin citizens. As Kitty would say, we are all in this together.
