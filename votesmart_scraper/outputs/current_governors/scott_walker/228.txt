Governor Walker Issues Executive Order to Prevent Potential Gasoline and Diesel Shortages
Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker issued Executive Order #197 today declaring an energy emergency following the temporary closing of the West Shore Pipeline, which runs from Milwaukee to Green Bay.
"We're taking action with this Executive Order to alleviate potential gasoline and diesel shortages as a result of the temporary shutdown of the West Shore Pipeline," Governor Walker said. "As the demand for fuel rises with the summer season, it's crucial we have a plan in place to ensure Wisconsin travelers have the fuel they need to not only explore our great state but also continue their normal business operations."
Executive Order #197 waives certain state and federal regulations limiting the number of hours motor fuel carrier drivers can drive per week. This flexibility allows truck drivers to alleviate potential supply shortages caused by the temporary shutdown of the West Shore Pipeline.
