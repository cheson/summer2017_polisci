Governor Walker Applauds "No Child Left Behind" Waiver Approval
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 6, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Walker applauded the U.S. Department of Education's approval of Wisconsin's waiver for flexibilities under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
Governor Walker released the following statement regarding the announcement of the waiver:
For the past year and a half we have worked with Democrats, Republicans, and a wide variety of education stakeholders to develop systems to help our schools and teachers improve. This waiver puts more power in the hands of Wisconsin's parents, educators, and elected officials to determine what is best for students in each community.
I am hopeful that Congress will continue to work toward a more permanent refining of the federal government's role in education.
In the meantime, we must continue to develop a fair and transparent system for evaluating and improving our state's public, choice, and charter schools. Together we will replicate successful schools while finding ways to improve schools that are not achieving results.
I will continue to work with Superintendent Evers and others with the goal of improving education for students all across Wisconsin.
