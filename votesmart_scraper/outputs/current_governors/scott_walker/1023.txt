Earlier this week, Governor Scott Walker's op-ed titled "Global Opportunities for Wisconsin Businesses" appeared in the 21st Century Business Herald in China and other Chinese media outlets. The full text of the op-ed is below:
Global Opportunities for Wisconsin Businesses
Leading Wisconsin's trade mission to China will strengthen our relationship with your country, build trade ties between Wisconsin firms and Chinese businesses and investors, and reinforce the strong position Wisconsin has in the global marketplace.
Our trade mission will include meetings in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, with in-depth, one-on-one meetings in each location. I look forward to meeting with Wisconsin businesses already operating in China.
More than 20 representatives from Wisconsin businesses, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection will join me on this trade mission. The companies participating in the trade mission represent the some of the strongest sectors of Wisconsin's economy, such as advanced manufacturing; environmental and water remediation; clean energy production, storage, and distribution; and food processing and safety.
China is an important market for key Wisconsin exports, including industrial machinery, medical equipment, clean energy and clean water technologies, and agricultural products. China is Wisconsin's third largest export market. In 2012, exports to China increased by 11.8 percent--totaling $1.5 billion. Throughout the trade mission, my main goal will be to promote Wisconsin-based businesses and the high-quality products and services they can provide to consumers and citizens in China.
