Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: Jan. 19, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today the State Assembly Committee on Veterans and Military Affairs unanimously passed Assembly Bills 429 and 438, both part of Governor Walker's Wisconsin Working plan. Assembly Bill 429 as amended grants a one-time occupational or professional license fee waiver for qualified veterans of the Armed Forces, National Guard and Reserves. Its companion, Senate Bill 338, passed the State Senate on Tuesday with unanimous support. Assembly Bill 438 recognizes military training, education or experience as meeting certain requirements for some state professional credentials. Both bills received bipartisan support and were passed by committee 11-0.
"We owe it to our veterans to assist them in obtaining jobs," said Governor Walker. "I thank Representative Wynn for authoring this legislation and the Assembly committee for its strong bipartisan support of the bills."
