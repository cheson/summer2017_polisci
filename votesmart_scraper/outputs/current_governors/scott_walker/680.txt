Location: Madison, WI

Smartphone users now have another way to use technology to connect with and explore Wisconsin's many state parks, forests trails, and recreation areas by downloading a free Wisconsin State Parks and Forests Pocket Ranger® App. The app offers visitors an accessible, comprehensive guide to exploring Wisconsin's state parks and forests at their convenience.
"So many people rely on smartphones for information, and this new technology will help connect them with the great outdoor recreational opportunities at our state parks, forests, and trails," said Governor Walker. "This is a great way to support tourism -- by making it even easier for people to see all that Wisconsin has to offer."
The app includes descriptions of each park, forest, and trail, along with what amenities it offers, and maps and directions. It includes an advanced GPS mapping feature that will locate the closest state properties, and allow users to take GPS tours, record trail distances and time elapsed, and mark photo waypoints.
The app has a real-time calendar of events, allowing users to search by property, date, and type of event. It also includes a social networking and photo/video sharing feature and a "Friend Finder," that allows companions to keep track of each other on a trail or at a park or forest.
"By bridging technology with Wisconsin's beautiful parks and forests, we aim to make it even easier for people to connect with the bountiful outdoor opportunities available in our state," said DNR Secretary Cathy Stepp.
The Wisconsin State Parks and Forests Pocket Ranger® is available on iTunes and Android Market. To download, visit dnr.wi.gov, search keyword "mobile apps."
