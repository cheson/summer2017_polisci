Governor Scott Walker today announced Wisconsin received a $32.5 million federal grant over five years to connect 1,000 youths with special needs to resources that transition them towards economic self-sufficiency and independence.
The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs awarded Wisconsin the Promoting Readiness of Minors in Supplemental Security Income (PROMISE) Grant. The grant seeks to increase the education, career, and income outcomes of children with special needs receiving federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and their families.
"The PROMISE Grant will help individuals and families across the state move from dependence to the independence of paid work experience, which will improve lives and brighten our state's future," Governor Walker said. "The grant supports increased financial literacy, improved job readiness, and reduced reliance on public assistance. It also includes career development plans to ensure today's youths with disabilities receive the support they need to be integral members of tomorrow's adult workforce."
The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development's Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) will work with the Department of Health Services, Department of Children and Families, and Department of Public Instruction to coordinate services and use best practices to prepare young adults for the workplace.
"Wisconsin's public schools are working hard to make sure every child graduates well prepared for career or college," said State Superintendent Tony Evers. "This federal funding will allow us to coordinate services for children and young adults with special needs, better preparing them for transition and success after high school."
