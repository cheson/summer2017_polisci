Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 11, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

overnor Scott Walker will testify on budget reforms before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Government Reform during the committee's April 14 hearing on "State and Municipal Debt: Tough Choices Ahead". The hearing will be held at 9:30 a.m. in room 2154 of the Rayburn House Office Building.
"I look forward to talking with Congress about the reforms we're implementing in Wisconsin," said Governor Scott Walker. "In Wisconsin we're making the tough choices today so we don't leave an even larger problem for the next generation. I believe that by demonstrating a commitment to the future we will give businesses the confidence they need to grow and create jobs."
In announcing the hearing Chairman Darrell Issa said:
"Spending at the local, state, and federal level is raising unmanageable debts and sinking our future. U.S. states and municipalities are starting to look increasingly like Greece, Spain, and Portugal. Rather than kick the can down the road in Wisconsin, Governor Walker's actions to cut spending and address over-compensation of public employees are putting his state government in a stronger financial position. The credit rating agency Moody's recently announced that these reforms will have a positive impact on Wisconsin's credit rating. The Committee looks forward to hearing from Governor Walker about the challenge ahead and the tough choices leaders at all levels of government must make to get control of our debt and spending problems."
