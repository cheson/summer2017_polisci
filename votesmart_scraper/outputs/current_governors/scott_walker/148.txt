Governor Scott Walker today announced the appointment of Attorney Gregory J. Strasser to serve a judge on the Marathon County Circuit Court, replacing outgoing Judge Greg Grau.
"I am pleased to appoint Gregory Strasser as judge in Marathon County," said Governor Walker. "Greg has shown a lifelong commitment to serving the people of Marathon County and I am confident he will quickly establish himself as an elite jurist."
Strasser is a co-founder of Strasser & Yde, S.C. in Wausau where he has practiced since 1997 as a civil litigator with extensive trial experience and as a mediator. Strasser served as President of the Marathon County Bar Association from 2006-2007, as the Director of Abby Bank since 2012, and as President of Fromm Bros. Historical Preservation Society since 2011.
Wausau District 6 Alderman Keene Winters wrote in support of Strasser. "Greg believes the role of the judiciary is to apply the law, not create new law," said Alderman Winters. "In Wausau he is a sought-after board member, a little league backer, a high school mock trial coach, and an active supporter of community charities. Greg is everything you would expect in a community minded professional."
Portage County Circuit Court Judge Robert Shannon highly recommends Strasser, stating, "Greg has managed to perform at the highest levels of the profession while always maintaining the trust and respect of opposing counsel. His demeanor, legal knowledge, and ability are the perfect blend of attributes."
Strasser is a Wausau native and graduate of Wausau West High School. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Juris Doctor degree from Hamline University School of Law.
