Today Governor Walker's office announced the federal government granted his request for a disaster designation in Lincoln and Marathon Counties for 2011 crop losses. Additionally Clark, Langlade, Oneida, Portage, Price, Shawano, Taylor, Waupaca, and Wood Counties received the designation of contiguous disaster counties.
"The federal government's recognition of crop losses in 2011 and their designation of these counties as a disaster area will ultimately help the economy in these areas," said Governor Walker. "Giving farmers access to capital to manage the losses experienced last year will help not only the agricultural economy, but also the local communities as well."
