Weekly Radio Address: Happy Independence Day!
Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Hi, Scott Walker here.
We came together this week as a state and as a nation to celebrate the birth of the United States of America.
As we celebrate our independence, we also bear in mind those who keep us safe every single day.
We hold our loved ones just a little bit tighter as we remember that freedom is not free. It was paid for by our founders, who paved the way for our great nation by fighting for our liberty. It's been paid for by the brave men and women who served in our Armed Forces, and by those who continue to serve today.
We can never repay our brave men and women in uniform, but we can thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their service and sacrifice.
I hope that you had a chance to attend your local Independence Day parade, grill hot dogs, burgers, and brats in the great Wisconsin outdoors, and to watch the fireworks with your loved ones throughout the week.
As we celebrate our nation's independence, may God bless you, your family, the State of Wisconsin, and the United States of America.
