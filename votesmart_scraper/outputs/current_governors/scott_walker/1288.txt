Each e-update I will answer a question submitted by a recipient of the previous e-update or from someone who contacts my office directly.
Question: You said property taxes went down, but mine went up. How can that happen?
Answer: Upon taking office as Governor, I sought to control property taxes while addressing a $3.6 billion state budget deficit. I did both by instituting reforms that gave local governments the tools to keep property taxes in check while also continuing needed services. Without the property tax controls and reforms in my budget, estimates show that median value homeowners would have seen their property taxes rise by $710 over the next two years.
The results of my reforms are now being seen. School tax levies dropped for the first time in six years while keeping our average classroom size lower than the national average.
Individual property tax bills may vary from these results. School, county, municipal, technical college and state taxes are all included in your tax bill. The taxes levied by these governments depend on decisions made by various governing boards. State aids, levy controls, and property values also play a role.
For example, if a school district recently passed a referendum to exceed levy limits imposed by the state, taxes may have gone up in that district. Another example could be that a city may have borrowed money and they are now paying that debt back through the levy. These situations exist due to local decisions that are best explained on a case by case basis by talking to your local elected officials, municipal clerk, and/or assessor.
