Federal Court Upholds Act 10
Statement
By: Scott Walker

Today, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rendered a decision in Wisconsin Education Association Council, et al. v. Walker, et al. Below is Governor Walker's reaction to the decision:
As we've said all along, Act 10 is constitutional.
Today's court ruling is a victory for Wisconsin taxpayers. The provisions contained in Act 10, which have been upheld in federal court, were vital in balancing Wisconsin's $3.6 billion budget deficit without increasing taxes, without massive public employee layoffs, and without cuts to programs like Medicaid. With this ruling behind us, we can now focus on the next state budget, which will invest in priorities to move our state forward.
