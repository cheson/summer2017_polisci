Today the Assembly Committee on Aging & Long Term Care recommended AB 477/SB 380 as amended for passage on a vote of 6-0. This legislation would lift the caps on Family Care.
"Lifting the cap on Family Care will help provide care for Wisconsinites truly in need," said Governor Walker. "Helping citizens in need, while being financially responsible, deserves bipartisan support. I would like to thank Representative Dean Kaufert and Senator Terry Moulton for their leadership on this legislation."
