Governor Walker issued the following statement after the President delivered remarks at Master Lock.
"I'm glad that the President highlighted two companies we worked with during the past year to create jobs in Wisconsin," said Governor Walker. "I worked closely with the City of Wausau to bring Collaborative Consulting to our state. The President also mentioned Diamond Precision Products, another company our administration worked with to help them grow in our state. Finally, I was pleased to hear the President mention Caterpillar because their world-wide mining headquarters is in our state. We are currently pushing legislation to streamline safe and environmentally sound mining to create more jobs in Wisconsin."
Earlier today, the Governor presented the President with his very own Brewers jersey with "Obama 1" on the back. Last time the President was in Wisconsin, Governor Walker gave him a Packers jersey.
