Location: Chicago, IL

Governor Scott Walker joined leaders from the tri-state area today in Chicago for the third annual Summit on Regional Competitiveness. The 2015 summit featured panels and keynote speeches that focused on unlocking the economic potential of the region.
"In Wisconsin, we remain focused on initiatives helping to improve our business climate and allowing job seekers and creators alike to grow and prosper," said Governor Walker. "One of our top priorities is connecting job creators with the skilled workers they need to fill open positions. To do this, we continue to invest in initiatives and programs like the Wisconsin Fast Forward grant program, local youth apprenticeships, and K-12 schools that graduate students with industry-recognized credentials. All of these programs are targeted to reduce workforce shortages here in Wisconsin. We focus on programs like these because we know that effective worker training programs are actually economic development efforts that lead to a more free and prosperous state."
