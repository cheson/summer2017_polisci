Following the news of Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) Secretary Kitty Rhoades' passing, Governor Scott Walker wrote to DHS Deputy Secretary Tom Engels and named him Interim Secretary pending the appointment of Secretary Rhoades' successor.
"Our hearts all ache following the passing of Kitty, who was an important part of our administration and a close friend," Governor Walker said. "In the wake of this tragedy, we need someone to step into the role of Secretary at the Department of Health Services and carry on Kitty's legacy. I have no doubt that Tom will serve the people of Wisconsin well as Interim Secretary as we begin the process to appoint Kitty's successor."
Kevin Moore will continue to serve as Wisconsin's Medicaid Director.
