Hi, this is Scott Walker.
February in Wisconsin is Career and Technical Education Month -- which means I hit the road this week to tour Kaukauna High School and their Career and Technical Education program.
Career and Technical Education programs open the door for great opportunities, allowing students to graduate with real-world experience. CTE programs provide students with a school-to-career connection through practical applications of their studies. For example, the Kaukauna school district offers Career and Technical Education programs in business and marketing, technology and engineering, and family and consumer sciences.
In December 2013, I was proud to sign Act 59 establishing a grant program for school districts participating in career and technical education. Each year, the Department of Public Instruction will consult with the state Department of Workforce Development and the Wisconsin Technical Education System to identify industries facing a shortage of adequately trained, entry-level workers.
By working together to identify industry sectors lacking workers, we will train the next generation of skilled workers, while also setting up our students for success upon graduation. The skills gap is a real concern in Wisconsin, and the Career and Technical Education program is one way we're working together to stem the issue and continue moving Wisconsin forward.
