Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 181 into law today at MCT, Inc. in Milwaukee. Assembly Bill 181 establishes an economic development program within the Department of Administration (DOA) to invest in venture capital funds.
"Job creation depends on new business ventures, and the $25 million allocated for this program in the state budget will help grow private sector jobs by investing in start-up companies," Governor Walker said. "One hundred percent of the funds from this program will go to Wisconsin-based businesses, and there are a number of measures in place to ensure accountability and transparency for the hard-working taxpayers."
The program will operate under a "fund of funds" investment model. Under the new law, the DOA Secretary will form a five-member committee to select an investment manager who will invest state funds, along with other private investment dollars, with multiple venture capital funds who in turn invest the dollars directly in Wisconsin-based businesses. The committee will consist of representatives from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and DOA's Capital Finance Office, and the investment manager selected must have expertise with venture capital or private equity.
"I hope that once success is shown, it will lead to additional measures to increase the amount of capital for new businesses and more Wisconsin jobs," Governor Walker continued. "I thank Representative Mike Kuglitsch (R-New Berlin) and Senator Alberta Darling (R-River Hills) for their leadership on this bill, which received enormous bipartisan support."
Assembly Bill 181 passed the Assembly on a vote of 91-2 and the Senate on a vote of 29-3. Assembly Bill 181 is Wisconsin Act 41.
