Governor Scott Walker delivered remarks at the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA) Advocacy Day this afternoon at the Monona Terrace. The event motivates and educates health care employees on relevant health care issues and advocacy opportunities. During the event, Governor Walker also signed Senate Bill 628 into law, which modernizes the collection of hospital data.
"One of our top priorities continues to be ensuring effective, efficient, and accountable services to our taxpayers, and the legislation we're signing here today helps accomplish that," Governor Walker said. "Our current system for collecting hospital data was designed in 1989. Senate Bill 628 helps us modernize the program to more efficiently target health care resources and improve outcomes for our citizens."
Senate Bill 628 -- makes various technical changes to the collection, analysis, and dissemination of hospital data including: aligning the submission of data to a format that is already used by most hospitals; allowing reports to be distributed electronically, except upon specific requests for paper copies; allowing hospitals to report more detailed location data; and allowing the release of data on race and ethnicity, in order to better understand social health disparities. Authored by Senator Howard Marklein (R -- Spring Green) and Representative Dale Kooyenga (R -- Brookfield), the bill passed the Senate on a voice vote and was concurred by the Assembly on a voice vote. It is Act 287.
