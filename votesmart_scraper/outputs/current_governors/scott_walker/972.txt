Statement

Governor Scott Walker issued the following statement today in response to the United States House of Representatives passing H.R. 2353:
I applaud the U.S. House for its approval of H.R. 2353, which is important bipartisan legislation allowing for those trucks currently carrying loads greater than 80,000 pounds and operating on U.S. Highway 41 in Wisconsin to continue operating on the road when it is converted to Interstate 41.
I commend Congressman Tom Petri of Wisconsin's 6th District and Congressman Reid Ribble of Wisconsin's 8th District for their outstanding leadership in moving this legislation forward in the House.
This is a great win for Wisconsin's economy and for the many Wisconsin manufacturers and retail businesses using this highway to move goods to and from market. Senator Tammy Baldwin and Senator Ron Johnson are advocating for this legislation in the Senate, and given the many economic benefits to our state and the country this conversion would bring, I urge the Senate to pass this legislation promptly.
Note: H.R. 2353 does not increase truck size or weight operating on the corridor, and it has no fiscal impact on the federal budget.
