Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Growing Our Economy: Investing in Venture Capital."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
On Thursday, I signed Assembly Bill 181 which creates a venture capital program in our state. This legislation works to increase the amount of venture capital by directing the Department of Administration to create a new economic development program.
Job creation depends on new business ventures, and the $25 million dollars already allocated for this program in the state budget will help grow private sector jobs by investing in start-up companies in the advanced manufacturing, engineering, agriculture, information technology, and medical device industries. One hundred percent of the funds will go to Wisconsin-based businesses. I hope that once success is shown, it will lead to additional measures to increase the amount of capital for new businesses and more jobs.
Assembly Bill 181 also shows we are serious about the commitment we are making to employers who are growing and thriving in Wisconsin to create jobs for the people of our state. I thank members of the State Senate and Assembly for quickly passing this legislation with broad bipartisan support. Working together, we are moving Wisconsin's economy forward.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
