Hello, this is Scott Walker.
New monthly job estimates are in, and the numbers show Wisconsin is working again.
The state's private sector created 48,500 private sector jobs during the year ending in April, according to the federal government's latest figures. We also gained 3,600 manufacturing jobs during the month of April alone.
The unemployment rate that reached 9.2 percent in 2010, well, it's now down to 4.4 percent, a full percentage point below the national average and the lowest unemployment rate since April 2008.
Other economic indicators, such as record exports and the continuing creation of new business entities, also point to growth in Wisconsin's economy.
It's no wonder that Chief Executive Magazine ranked Wisconsin the "12th Best State for Business" in its annual survey of CEOs, a dramatic turnaround from our ranking of 41st in the nation in 2010.
Clearly, our state's strong business climate and world-class workforce make Wisconsin an attractive place to locate or expand.
That's why in Wisconsin, we are investing in proven talent development programs like Registered Apprenticeship, Youth Apprenticeship and Wisconsin Fast Forward. These programs build skills that are in demand with employers and lead to family-supporting jobs.
Efforts like these will keep Wisconsin working now and in the future.
