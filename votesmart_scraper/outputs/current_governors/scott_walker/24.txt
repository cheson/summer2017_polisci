Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today in honor of Memorial Day:
Many of us think of Memorial Day as the official beginning of summer. And while the long weekend is a great chance for us to spend the day with friends and loved ones in the great Wisconsin outdoors, it's important we remember the true meaning of this holiday. The brave men and women who serve in the United States Armed Forces make the selfless decision every day to stand up for our nation's ideals and protect our freedoms. Every day, but especially today, we remember those who paid the ultimate price for that freedom with their lives. We hold these American heroes in our hearts. We keep them, and their loved ones, in our thoughts and prayers.
Yesterday, Governor Walker joined the Union Grove community in honoring members of the United States Armed Forces at a Memorial Day Ceremony. Today, he will deliver remarks at Memorial Day Ceremonies in Milwaukee and Madison.
Governor Walker also issued Executive Order #246 ordering the flag of the United States and the flag of the State of Wisconsin be flown at half-staff on Memorial Day. A copy of the executive order is attached.
