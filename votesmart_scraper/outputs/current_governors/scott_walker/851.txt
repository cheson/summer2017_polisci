Propane Shortage

Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
The shortage of propane in the Midwest is a big problem here in Wisconsin. If you or someone you know needs help, please call toll-free at 1-866-HEATWIS (432-8947).
There is no one reason for the shortage. Days of extreme cold, a wet fall that caused farmers to use more propane to dry corn, and the shutdown of a pipeline are all contributors to this serious problem.
This past fall, I lifted limits so truck drivers could drive longer to bring in propane. Since then, I've lifted weight limits for trucks to carry even more propane into the state.
Last weekend, I declared an emergency so we could make moves more quickly. On Monday, I met with the propane industry. The state will put up $8 million to help the many small businesses that deliver propane get lines of credit so none of the propane is sitting at suppliers when it needs to be getting to homes.
