Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 284 today at Badger Middle School, which allows students in grades 7 and 8 to earn credit toward a high school diploma for completing qualified high-school level courses.
"Many students are already taking advanced course work in middle school, but are not able to receive credit toward their diploma for their work," Governor Walker said. "By awarding credit for classes such as Algebra, we give students additional flexibility to continue taking advanced courses in high school. I thank Senator Glenn Grothman (R-West Bend) and Representative Pat Strachota (R-West Bend) for their leadership on this bill."
Senate Bill 284 -- allows students to earn high school credit for successful completion of advance coursework offered in high schools. Credit can only be given for classes taught by a teacher who is licensed to teach the same course at the high school level. The curriculum and exams must be equivalent to those used at the high school level.
The Department of Public Instruction, Association of Wisconsin School Administrators, Wisconsin Association of School Boards, Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators, Wisconsin Council for Administrators of Special Services, School Administrators Alliance and the West Bend School District all registered in favor of the bill. It passed both the Senate and the Assembly on a voice vote and is Act 138.
