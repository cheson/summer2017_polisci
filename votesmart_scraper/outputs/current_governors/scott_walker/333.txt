Governor Scott Walker traveled throughout Wisconsin today to roll out his college affordability legislative package, which focuses on making higher education more affordable for Wisconsin's families and students. Governor Walker joined faculty, staff, students, lawmakers, and community members at University of Wisconsin (UW)-Eau Claire, Nicolet College, and UW-Superior to discuss this new legislation, as well as highlight the positive impact the historic four-year tuition freeze has had on the University of Wisconsin system.
"With two sons in college, I know how important it is to ensure college is affordable for both college students and the working families of this state," Governor Walker said. "One of the most important things we've done for higher education in Wisconsin is freeze UW System tuition for the past four years. This college affordability legislative package will build on the tuition freeze to continue to make higher education more accessible and more affordable for Wisconsinites."
