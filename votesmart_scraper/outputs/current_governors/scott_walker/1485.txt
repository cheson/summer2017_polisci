Issue Position

I believe in the people of Wisconsin. I believe in their can-do attitude and commitment to excellence. I have witnessed firsthand the generous spirit that makes Wisconsin such a wonderful place to call home.

Government's first duty is to provide for the safety of its citizens. This means protecting the rights of crime victims and providing the brave men and women in Wisconsin law enforcement the resources they need to keep our schools and neighborhoods safe.

I believe our leaders have a responsibility to protect human life at all stages and to support policies that reflect the values and priorities of the people whom they serve.

I understand that Wisconsin families are struggling to make ends meet. The last thing they need is a government that continues to grow faster than their ability to pay. For the last eight years as Executive of the state's most populous county, I have kept my promise to spend the taxpayers' money as if it were my own - and I will continue to do so as your Governor.

It is time for new leadership and a new direction for our state. Together, we can build a better Wisconsin - a Wisconsin we can believe in again.
