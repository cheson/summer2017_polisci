Will Expand Vets Board, Ensure Geographic Diversity
Scott Walker, Milwaukee County executive and Republican nominee for governor, today with local veterans, unveiled his plans to honor Wisconsin's commitment to our veterans.
"Wisconsin's veterans and their families represent the true values of Wisconsin," said Walker. "When their country and state called, they answered without hesitation. When our veterans return home, it is our responsibility to meet our commitment to them as well as their families who offer love and support. It is the right thing to do, and the Wisconsin thing to do."

Walker's plans put emphasis on a more representative Board of Veterans Affairs. He will expand the current board to nine members and will require that the board be comprised of a member from each of Wisconsin's eight congressional districts plus one at-large member.

Walker's plan to support Wisconsin's veterans also builds on efforts he's made as Milwaukee County executive to support veterans. Walker would ensure the long-term fiscal solvency of the Veterans Trust Fund by, in part, directing his newly created Waste, Fraud and Abuse Commission to find ways to eliminate bureaucracy to focus more directly on providing services to veterans.
Finally, Walker will reaffirm his support for the Wisconsin GI Bill and vital programs like Mission: Welcome Home.
