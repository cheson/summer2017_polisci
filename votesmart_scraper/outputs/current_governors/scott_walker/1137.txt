Governor Walker's Comment on Pension Report
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 2, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Today the Department of Administration (DOA) and the Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) released a joint study that evaluated the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) over the last four years. The DOA and ETF study showed that the WRS is currently a sustainable system for both taxpayers and annuitants.
This joint study report comes on the heels of a PEW study, which showed that Wisconsin's pension system is the only in the nation to be 100% funded.
In reaction to the ETF and DOA study, Governor Walker released the following statement:
The report released today confirms that both taxpayers and pensioners are getting a great deal with the WRS. Compared to other states, Wisconsin consistently rates among the best performing public pension systems in the country.
Both the State of Wisconsin and WRS must be fiscally sustainable moving forward to ensure that we can meet our outstanding benefit obligations, which I am confident we can do. The long term structural changes we made last year will help ensure that the state is able to fulfill the commitment it has made to pensioners.
I want to be very clear: I am currently not planning to make any substantial changes to the WRS. However, I will continue to work to ensure that the WRS is fiscally sustainable for both taxpayers and retirees.
