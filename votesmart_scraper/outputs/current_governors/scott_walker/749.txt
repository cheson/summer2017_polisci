By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker thanked teachers around Wisconsin and throughout the country today on National Thank A Teacher Day:
Teachers have a lasting influence on the children they teach. Each of us has that one teacher who really inspired us to learn and tackle each difficult math problem, science project, or history lesson. For me, that person was my third grade teacher -- Mrs. Basley. Thank you, Mrs. Basley, and all other teachers like her who challenge our students and give them the knowledge to help guide them throughout life.
The U.S. Department of Education encourages you to use #ThankATeacher to thank a special teacher and post about the impact they had on your life.
