Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 13, 2013
Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 14 into law. Along with signing the bill, Governor Walker released the following statement:
The bipartisan and nearly unanimous support for our "Wisconsin Fast Forward" legislation shows how important it is to develop our state's workforce and close the skills gap. We all agree we need to continue to do everything we can to ensure workers have the necessary skills for jobs available today.
This bill will help address the skills gap by investing in worker training grants and developing a Labor Market Information System. Altogether, these investments will focus a concerted effort to connect workers with jobs.
I would like to thank State Representative Kathy Bernier (R-Chippewa Falls), State Senator Rick Gudex (R-Fond du Lac), and State Senator Robert Cowles (R-Green Bay) for authoring this bill.
The bill passed the Assembly 94-4 and the Senate with a 33-0 vote.
