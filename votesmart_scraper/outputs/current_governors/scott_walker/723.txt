Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker thanked his father, grandfather, and uncles today, as well as all fathers across the state on this Father's Day.
As a father, I know first-hand the joy and fulfillment the responsibility of fatherhood can bring. This Father's Day, I want to take the opportunity to thank my father, Llew Walker, for your guidance and support and for being a great example for me. I'd also like to express my sincere gratitude to the men of Wisconsin who act as positive role models for their sons, grandsons, nephews, and family friends. Your presence in these young lives is essential and far more important than you may ever realize.
