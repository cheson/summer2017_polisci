Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: May 1, 2014
Location: Appleton, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker joined local leaders and members of the medical community at the Northeast Wisconsin (NEW) Mental Health Connection to mark the beginning of Mental Health Awareness Month. This year's Mental Health Awareness Month theme is "No Health without Mental Health" and focuses on increasing access to mental health services and removing the stigma of mental illness that may prevent people from seeking treatment.
"Every day, people suffering from mental illness go untreated because of the stigma surrounding this issue," Governor Walker said. "Our goal is increase awareness, and offer greater access to treatment so everyone needing assistance can, and will, get it. This investment in mental health services is long overdue in Wisconsin, and our community-centered approach will yield the greatest results, so members of our state living with mental illness can prosper."
Mental Health Awareness Month is part of a larger effort by Governor Walker to improve treatment and support of people living with mental illness, including a historic investment of more than $30 million dollars to expand mental health services. Governor Walker also declared 2014 as the year of A Better Bottom Line, to promote the benefits of hiring of people with disabilities, including those with mental illness.
