Governor Scott Walker today released the following statement after the Wisconsin State Assembly passed his Blueprint for Prosperity on a bipartisan vote of 62-37:
As I travel our state, people aren't telling me they pay too little in taxes. In fact, most people I talk to think the tax burden is too high, which is why our plan returns the vast majority of the budget surplus to its rightful owners: the hardworking taxpayers of Wisconsin. I'm pleased to see our Blueprint for Prosperity receive bipartisan support in the Assembly. The purpose of our plan is to deliver significant property and income tax relief to the entire state, and I hope to sign it into law soon.
