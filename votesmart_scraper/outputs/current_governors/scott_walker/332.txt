Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined dairy and agriculture industry representatives today at the Dairy Strong 2016: Partners in Progress conference at the Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center in Madison. This annual event brings together members of the Wisconsin Dairy Business Association (DBA) and its affiliated co-op, the Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative (DBMMC).
"It was great to speak with many of our leading dairy experts here today," Governor Walker said. "Our dairy industry is crucial to our economic success, contributing $43.4 billion to Wisconsin's economy every year. Each Wisconsin dairy cow typically generates over $34,000 a year in economic activity, most of which stays within the local community to support businesses and schools in the area."
