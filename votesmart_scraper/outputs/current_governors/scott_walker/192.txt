Governor Scott Walker addressed Donaldson Company, Inc. employees today in Baldwin and had the opportunity to tour the facility. The Baldwin facility serves worldwide markets in agriculture, industrial, construction, defense, heavy duty transportation, and light truck markets.
"We're proud of how far Wisconsin has come since we first took office," Governor Walker said. "Our unemployment rate is less than half what it was in January 2010 and more people are working in Wisconsin than ever before. One of the largest job growth we've seen has been in manufacturing jobs and Wisconsin ranks in the top ten in the nation for manufacturing jobs since we took office with an estimated 34,100 jobs created. We're excited to be here today to meet with Donaldson Company, Inc. employees and leadership to learn more about how we can continue to strengthen Wisconsin's workforce and economy looking forward."
The Donaldson Company, Inc. was founded in 1915 and is a global leader in filtration systems with 11,000 employees world-wide.
