Today, Governor Scott Walker sent U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius a letter. Along with the letter, Governor Walker released the following statement:
Wisconsin has been a leader in welfare reform for decades, emphasizing the fundamentals of work and personal responsibility. We believe those who can work should work. Work gives individuals dignity and purpose.
New guidance from the Obama administration raises serious concerns about their commitment to moving low-income families from welfare to work. We urge them to reconsider and adopt the approach pioneered by Governor Tommy Thompson and approved by President Bill Clinton.
