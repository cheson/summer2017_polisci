Growing Our Economy: Governor Scott Walker Signs Bill to Protect Aviation Jobs in Wisconsin
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: April 3, 2014
Location: Appleton, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 348 into law at Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation in Appleton. Gulfstream employs over 800 people in Wisconsin and is the largest general aviation employer in the state.
"This legislation allows Wisconsin to compete with other states for aircraft maintenance and labor," Governor Walker said. "Senate Bill 348 fosters job growth and sustainability for Wisconsin's aviation industry. I applaud Senator Ellis (R-Neenah) and Representative Steineke (R-Kaukauna) for their work on this bipartisan legislation."
Senate Bill 348 -- expands sales and use tax exemptions to all aircraft parts, maintenance, and repair improving the competitiveness of Wisconsin's aviation industry. Prior to this legislation, Wisconsin aircraft service companies were at a competitive disadvantage because many states had broader aircraft service-related sales tax exemptions. Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota already have an exemption for aircraft maintenance and it is easy for pilots to simply fly over Wisconsin to have repairs done in a neighboring state. Senate Bill 348 levels the playing field by making it more affordable to complete repairs and routine maintenance on aircrafts.
The bill passed the Senate 25-7 and the Assembly 93-0; it is as Act 185.
