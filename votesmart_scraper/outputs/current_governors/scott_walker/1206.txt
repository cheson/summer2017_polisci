Today Governor Walker signed four bipartisan bills aimed at growing Wisconsin's agricultural economy, Senate Bill (SB) 396, SB 410, SB 496, and Assembly Bill (AB) 82.
"Agriculture is one of the top industries that Wisconsin's economy was built on," said Governor Walker. "It will continue to play an important role moving forward, and by signing these bills today I am hopeful we will continue to see increased exports, productivity, and job growth in this important area of our state's economy. Today is another great example of how we've coming together to improve our state--I'm pleased to be signing bills authored by both Democrats and Republicans."
SB 396 was signed into law by Governor Walker. This law ensures reliability, confidentiality and affordability of Wisconsin's livestock premises registration information program and was authored by State Senator Harsdorf and State Representative Tauchen.
Governor Walker signed SB 410 into law, legislation that improves livestock farmers' ability to transport manure during certain key fertilizing times. This legislation was authored by former State Senator Pam Galloway and State Representative Petrowski.
AB 82 was also signed into law, legislation that provides compensation to those who have a possessory interest in a parcel of land that suffers a cougar depredation. This legislation was authored by State Representative Vruwink and State Senator Lassa.
Governor Walker also signed into law SB 496, legislation that aligns Wisconsin law with U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations, while maintaining public safety as cattle will still be tested at slaughter for brucellosis. This legislation was authored by State Senator Schultz and State Senator Nerison.
