Hi, Scott Walker here.
Our focus is always on making government work better for you -- the hardworking citizens of this state. That's why we are continuing to reform government by cutting red tape and easing the regulatory burden for taxpayers and small businesses here in Wisconsin.
Right now there is legislation focused on putting you in control, by ensuring Wisconsinites have input on new and costly regulations imposed upon Wisconsin businesses. This helps further our goals of right-sizing state government for you.
This legislation adds a new public hearing requirement for administrative regulations before they are even written. That's because we believe that if a costly regulation affects you, you should have an opportunity to tell the regulator what you think and they should be required to listen.
Regulations have real consequences for real people, and this bill gives the legislature the ability to request a second cost estimate for a proposed rule to ensure that our citizens and businesses have a voice through the involvement of the legislative branch.
This legislation has passed the Assembly, and we now call upon the Wisconsin State Senate to take up Assembly Bill 251 as soon as possible.
This bill is an important step as we continue moving Wisconsin forward with a government that is more effective, efficient, and accountable to you.
