Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 201 and Senate Bill 178 into law today following the Veterans Day ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
Assembly Bill 201 -- Gives veterans and active military priority when registering for classes within the University of Wisconsin System and at Wisconsin Technical Colleges. Many times our military members have difficulties registering for the classes they need to advance their careers. The bill was authored by Representative Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Senator Carpenter (D-Milwaukee).
"A great way to show support for our service members and veterans is to ensure they have the necessary resources available to succeed when they return home and are looking for a job," Governor Walker said. "This legislation means they have access to a quality education which can help propel their futures."
Senate Bill 178 -- Offers in-state rates for hunting, fishing, and trapping permits to recipients of the Purple Heart medal, regardless of their state of residence. This legislation thanks veterans for their service and sacrifice by offering them a reduced rate for permits and conservation licenses. The bill was authored by Senator Petrowski (R-Marathon) and Representative Petryk (R-Eleva).
"The Department of Natural Resources already offers reduced rates on permits and licenses for in-state veterans and active military," Governor Walker said. "I'm proud to extend this benefit to all troops injured while serving this great country."
