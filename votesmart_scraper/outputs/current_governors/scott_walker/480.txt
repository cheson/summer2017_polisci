Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
This week, I'm attending law enforcement memorials around the state as we continue to mourn the loss of one of our finest, Trooper Trevor Casper, who died earlier this year while protecting and serving his community.
His incredible sacrifice exemplifies his dedication and unwavering commitment to uphold his oath to protect and serve others. We continue to send our thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.
We are also thankful every day for the men and women across the state and around the country who are called to serve to keep our communities, neighborhoods, and families safe and protected from harm.
On behalf of Wisconsin, I want to thank our law enforcement officials for their hard work, dedication, and commitment -- and ask that we remember Trooper Casper and all those who have died in the line of duty while protecting their communities across our great state.
