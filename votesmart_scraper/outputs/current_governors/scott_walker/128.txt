Governor Walker Releases Statement Regarding Court of Appeals Voter ID Decision
Statement
By: Scott Walker
Date: Aug. 10, 2016
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement this morning after the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to stay the injunction issued by Judge Adelman regarding voter identification in Wisconsin:
Voter ID is a reasonable measure to protect Wisconsin voters against cheating and make sure every vote counts. Today's decision to halt the injunction issued by Judge Adelman is a step in the right direction. The decision recognized that his previous ruling is likely to be reversed in light of Supreme Court precedent and would create more uncertainty for voters. Voters in Wisconsin support voter ID, and our administration will continue to work to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat.
