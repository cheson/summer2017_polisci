Just Because It's Legal, Doesn't Mean It's Right

Job creators across the state have told me one of the key barriers to their decision to grow their businesses and add jobs, is instability. One of the sources of that instability is ObamaCare. Small business owners say it's hard to move forward with an expansion when your future health care expenses are likely to skyrocket.
Shortly after I took office, we joined a lawsuit fighting the constitutionality of ObamaCare. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, for the most part, to uphold the so-called Affordable Care Act, which includes a mandate for individuals and businesses. This is a blow to efforts to grow jobs here in Wisconsin, and across the country.
As recently as last year, the State conducted an actuarial analysis of the impact of ObamaCare and found, according to our data, that most people in Wisconsin would pay more money for fewer health care services than they have now.
The ObamaCare ruling results in a massive tax increase on the people of Wisconsin and America at a time when so many are just getting back on their feet.
With the legal challenge behind us, we are now hoping for a full repeal of ObamaCare. We are not going to spend time, effort, and resources on implementation until after the November elections. Just because the court says it's legal, doesn't mean it's right.
