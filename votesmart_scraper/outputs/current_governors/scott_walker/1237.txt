Below is a statement from Governor Walker regarding recent federal action on the S. 1134:
I applaud the President for signing S. 1134, the St. Croix River Crossing Project, into law today. I also give my sincere thanks to everyone who assisted in getting this legislation made into law over the years -- that is a very long list of people, groups and organizations.
The St. Croix River Crossing is a great example of what happens when everyone puts their differences aside, focuses on the needed end result and works together to successfully get something done. And Wisconsin is better off for it. We can now begin the process of constructing this bridge, a project that will bring thousands of jobs to our region and provide a safer route between Minnesota and Wisconsin.
This is a great day for Wisconsin.
