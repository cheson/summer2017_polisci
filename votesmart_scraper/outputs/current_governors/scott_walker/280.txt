Hi, Scott Walker here.
We proclaimed this week as Sunshine Week throughout the state.
Here in Wisconsin, we are committed to openness and transparency in all aspects of our operations and we want to set a standard for other states to follow as well.
Our office already goes above and beyond what is required by law when it comes to public records requests to make sure we are being as open and transparent as possible with our citizens. We've introduced new, effective initiatives to ensure public access to government across all of our state agencies.
This includes our recent Executive Order, which we issued last week directing all state agencies to implement standardized best practices in the processing of public records requests. We want to require more up-front clarity as to the costs of requests and require public records training for all state employees.
We also recently launched the new Agency Performance Dashboards website, which provides Wisconsinites with a user-friendly and a transparent tool to measure our ongoing efforts to move our state forward. We asked each agency to develop a performance dashboard and set aggressive goals in their performance measures, even if those goals could not be met right away.
State government and its services are meant for you -- the people of Wisconsin. To best meet your needs, agency goals will constantly be assessed and adjusted.
We continue to look for new and better ways to serve the public and by implementing these new initiatives, our citizens gain greater access to government services and processes far beyond what any previous administration has offered.
