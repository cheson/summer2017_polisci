Governor Scott Walker toured Argon Industries today as a part of his Working for Wisconsin Tour. This tour highlights initiatives and programs that are working for the people of Wisconsin. The visit to Argon Industries focuses on efforts being made to provide job seekers with the skills needed to bridge Wisconsin's skills gap.
"Job creators all over the state continue to share stories with us about their difficulties finding skilled workers to fill vacancies within their companies," said Governor Walker. "One of our top priorities is matching job seekers with high-paying, in-demand jobs in Wisconsin. Looking forward, we are focused on positive reforms that strengthen Wisconsin's workforce, so companies like Argon Industries and other manufacturers can find the talented workers they need to fill their open positions."
