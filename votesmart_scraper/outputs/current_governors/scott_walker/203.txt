Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined State Superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction Tony Evers, Major General Donald Dunbar, and Hartland Police Chief Robert Rosch to stress the continued importance of the "If You See Something, Say Something TM" campaign to students in Wisconsin.
"We all play a role in keeping our communities safe," Governor Walker said. "The "See Something, Say Something' campaign instructs and empowers Wisconsin citizens to take an active role in protecting our state. We will continue to work with the Department of Homeland Security to protect our state by encouraging all Wisconsinites to pay close attention to their surroundings and report any suspicious activity to local law enforcement."
The "If You See Something, Say Something Â™" campaign is a national safety public awareness action that was launched as a simple and effective program to raise public awareness of indicators of terrorism and violent crime. The state of Wisconsin fully adopted the initiatives in 2012 under the WiWATCH program, to further emphasize the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the proper state authorities and first responders.
WiWATCH provides a portal to educate the public and provide a means to report suspicious activity. For additional information, visit www.wiwatch.org or call 1-877-WI-WATCH.activity.
