Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Growing Our Economy: Investing in Venture Capital."
Transcript:
Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
This week, the state Senate and Assembly passed legislation that provides $25 million for qualified start-up companies here in Wisconsin, and I'm pleased the legislation will head to my desk after winning broad bi-partisan support.
Job creation depends on new business ventures, and the $25 million contained in this bill will help grow private sector jobs by investing in start-up companies in the advanced manufacturing, engineering, agriculture, information technology, and medical device industries. 100 percent of the funds will go to Wisconsin-based businesses.
My top priority is helping the people of Wisconsin create jobs, and this bipartisan legislation adds a much-needed economic development tool to our efforts. I hope that once success is shown, it will lead to additional measures to increase the amount of capital for new businesses and more jobs. This is one more example of how we're moving Wisconsin's economy forward.
The state partnered with the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association to produce and distribute a brief radio address once a week. Audio files and a written transcript of this radio address can be accessed on http://www.wi-broadcasters.org and http://walker.wi.gov/Weekly-Radio-Addresses.
