Governor Scott Walker released his Weekly Radio Address today titled "Putting Wisconsin Taxpayers First."
Hi, Scott Walker here.
We are putting Wisconsin taxpayers first.
With our latest state budget, we will provide more than $8 billion worth of tax relief over eight years. That's right -- $8 billion.
Once our state budget plan passes, property taxes and income taxes will be lower in 2018 than they were before we started in the year 2010.
For a typical family in Wisconsin, the cumulative reduction in income taxes alone is more than $1,500 over eight years. That's real money.
We even eliminated an entire tax in our budget. For the first time since 1931, there will be no state tax on your property tax bill. We are reducing the burden on the hard-working taxpayers of Wisconsin.
In fact, from 2010 to 2014, we outperformed 43 other states in lowering our overall tax burden.
Thanks to our Reform Dividend, we are able to continue to lower the tax burden while still providing historic levels of support for K-12 education across the state.
