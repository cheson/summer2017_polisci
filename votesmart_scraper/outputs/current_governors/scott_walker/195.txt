Press Release

Location: Burlington, WI

Governor Scott Walker provided remarks and joined in celebrating Burlington's 30th Annual "ChocolateFest" today. ChocolateFest is an annual festival hosted in Burlington, also known as "Chocolate City U.S.A.," dedicated to the celebration of all things chocolate.
"The annual ChocolateFest brings thousands of visitors to our state for good old fashioned family fun in Chocolate City U.S.A.," Governor Walker said. "This is just one of Wisconsin's unique tourist attractions. We're happy to be here to celebrate 30 years of ChocolateFest, and we will continue to make sure events like this remain a significant contributor to economic development and workforce growth in communities throughout our state."
For nearly 30 years, the volunteer-run ChocolateFest has attracted over 35,000 people to Burlington for a weekend of fun, rides, games, and, of course, chocolate. The festival not only offers delicious chocolate for children and adults alike, but it also raises money for more than 65 local and national charities.
ChocolateFest began as a small summer festival in 1987 to commemorate Nestl√©'s 20th anniversary of doing business in Burlington and continues to attract tourists to the area on a yearly basis. What started as a minor event hosted at local school auditoriums and athletic fields has grown into a major affair, requiring 20 acres of fairgrounds to accommodate thousands of guests.
The ChocolateFest committee is a non-profit organization with more than 950 volunteers staffing the Memorial Day weekend event. The primary mission of ChocolateFest is to maximize its ability to help local charities and service clubs raise money while also bringing a fun, tourist-oriented event to southeast Wisconsin.
Gates open today and events run throughout Memorial Day weekend, culminating with the Veteran's Memorial Day parade through downtown Burlington.
