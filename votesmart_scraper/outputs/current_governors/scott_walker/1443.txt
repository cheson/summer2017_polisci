Governor Walker's Commission on Waste, Fraud and Abuse released a website today that allows citizens to send in suggestions to the commission on ways government can reduce wasteful spending. The website can be reached by visiting http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/ and clicking on the Commission on Waste, Fraud, and Abuse link on the left-hand side.
"Making government leaner and more efficient is challenging work that will require innovative thinking and new ideas," said Governor Scott Walker. "Many of the best ideas come from the private sector, so we are asking the public to send in their suggestions to make our government better."
