Press Release

Location: Madison, WI

Today Governor Scott Walker signed Senate Bill 15 into law, which eliminates a mandate on local law enforcement agencies to gather burdensome and time consuming motor vehicle traffic stop information.
"This law eliminates an unfunded mandate on local law enforcement and maximizes our crime fighting resources," Governor Scott Walker said. "During tight budget times we need to set priorities in all areas of government, and this bill allows law enforcement agencies to focus on doing their job--protecting and serving the public. I thank Senators Lazich and Wanggaard and Representative Kathy Bernier for their leadership on this issue, as well as the broad coalition of sheriffs and chiefs of police across Wisconsin who supported this legislation."
