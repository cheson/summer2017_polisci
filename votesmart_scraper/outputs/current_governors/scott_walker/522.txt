Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
On Monday, I joined nearly 1,000 members of Wisconsin's tourism industry at the Wisconsin Governor's Conference on Tourism in La Crosse.
This conference draws citizens with a vested interest in tourism from across the state, and serves as Wisconsin's largest educational and networking event for the tourism industry. Tourism is a vital part of our economy, generating $1.35 billion in state and local revenue, employing nearly 185,000 Wisconsinites, and contributing $4.6 billion to personal income.
Growing and strengthening tourism in Wisconsin is critical as we continue our efforts to ensure greater freedom and prosperity for all. Investing in tourism promotion and marketing at the national, state, and local level is a sure-fire method to attract visitors and guarantee our economy continues to grow.
