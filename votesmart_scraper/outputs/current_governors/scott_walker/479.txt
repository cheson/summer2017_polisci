Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker attended the 25th annual Wisconsin Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony at the Memorial site outside the Wisconsin State Capitol today and presented a wreath on behalf of the people of Wisconsin honoring fallen law enforcement officers.
"We gather in honor and remembrance of the brave men and women who protect our communities, neighborhoods, and roadways. Today, we particularly honor those that paid the ultimate sacrifice answering the call of duty to defend our safety," Governor Walker said. "Their sacrifice cannot be repaid, but will never be forgotten. We hold their families and loved ones in our prayers."
The name of Polk County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Seversen was added to the memorial this year. Deputy Seversen was shot while pursuing a homicide suspect in 1991. The shooting left him paralyzed, and he died of complications from his paralysis in 2014.
After the suspect shot Deputy Seversen, he shot and killed Burnett County Sheriff's Deputy Allen Albee. Family members of Deputy Albee assisted in the wreath laying today. His name is already included on the memorial.
Deputy Michael Seversen is the 266th fallen officer now listed on the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Memorial in Madison.
