Today, Governor Scott Walker declared the month of October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month in Wisconsin. Every year, about 2,500 victims seek lifesaving assistance and shelter in Wisconsin. Last year, the state mourned the loss of 43 people to domestic violence, 36 of whom were victims of homicide.
"Domestic violence is a tragedy that impacts the lives of tens of thousands of Wisconsinites every year," said Governor Walker. "We have worked hard to support victims of domestic abuse by passing legislation strengthening protections and implementing reforms and services to provide victims and their children with the help and information they need to break the cycle of abuse. We are committed to continuing to protect and care for the most vulnerable among us."
