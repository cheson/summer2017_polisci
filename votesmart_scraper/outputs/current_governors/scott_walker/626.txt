Location: Madison, WI

Today, Governor Scott Walker announced the selection of the Christmas tree that will stand in the State Capitol rotunda this holiday season. Dennis and Kim Schoeneck, Pelican Lake, Wisconsin, will donate the 40 foot tall balsam fir, and a number of other trees, to decorate the Capitol square and the exterior of the Executive Residence.
"The 2014 Capitol Christmas tree will be adorned with hand-made ornaments from across that state, based on this year's theme - Honoring Wisconsin's Veterans -- which reminds us of the sacrifice made by those who serve our country, during the holidays and all year long," said Governor Scott Walker. "The Capitol Christmas Tree and its decorations provide a great opportunity for everyone to come and visit our beautiful State Capitol. I would like to thank Dennis and Kim Schoeneck for donating this year's tree, harvesting it, and delivering it to our State Capitol building."
"We are grateful for the opportunity to provide these trees as a small token of appreciation for the brave men and women, past and present, who have sacrificed so much for our country," Said Dennis and Kim Schoeneck. "We thank God for each and every one of you! God Bless America! "
The tree chosen as the Capitol Christmas tree must be a full Balsam Fir, approximately 35-55 feet tall. Governor Walker has requested the help of students from public and private schools across the state to craft and create ornaments to decorate the Christmas tree under the theme, Honoring Wisconsin's Veterans.
Kim and Dennis Schoeneck, owners of Schoeneck Tree Farm, were named 2014 National Regional Tree Farmers of the Year by the American Tree Farm SystemÂ® (ATFS), a program of the American Forest Foundation.
