Hi, Scott Walker here.
This week, I was in Mexico leading a business development mission to build and strengthen business ties and attract company operations and investments that are a good fit for Wisconsin's industries.
Joining me were representatives from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection. Together, we sat down with business and agriculture leaders to discuss opportunities to establish or grow ventures in Wisconsin.
As part of our trip, we had the opportunity to join Secretary Ben Brancel, Wisconsin businesses, and representatives from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls and University of Wisconsin-Madison at the 2016 CIGAL Trade Show for Dairy.
This show is a big deal in the dairy world, attracting exhibitors from throughout Mexico and the United States, and it focuses on the dairy production sector.
The trade show was held in Jalisco, Mexico, which has been our sister state since 1990. While there, we met with Jalisco Governor Sandoval to explain how we're moving Wisconsin forward and why this is a great time for businesses in Mexico to consider investing in our state.
Throughout our business development mission, we highlighted Wisconsin's strong business climate, outstanding workforce, and key industry sectors as compelling assets for successful business operations in our state. You see, we live in a global economy, and our work to build relationships in Mexico and around the world ultimately leads to more good jobs and a stronger economy right here at home in Wisconsin.
