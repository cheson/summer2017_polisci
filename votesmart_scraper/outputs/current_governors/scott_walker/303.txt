Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker released the following statement today regarding the Attorney General's office joining a lawsuit challenging the Obama Administration's implementation of a portion of the Affordable Care Act, known as the Health Insurance Providers Fee:
Once again, we are taking action to protect Wisconsin taxpayers from the adverse effects the Obama Administration's Affordable Care Act has on our citizens. If left unchallenged, the Health Insurance Providers Fee will force states to pay between $13-15 billion in payments over the next decade. This lawsuit is meant to ensure Wisconsinites are not left paying this unconstitutional and coercive tax, which could result in a loss of millions of dollars to Wisconsin's Medicaid program.
