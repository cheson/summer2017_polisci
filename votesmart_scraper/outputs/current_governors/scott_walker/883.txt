Developing Our Workforce: New Legislation Expands Youth Apprenticeship Programs
Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Rhinelander, WI

Governor Scott Walker traveled to Nicolet Area Technical College today to sign Senate Bill 336. The bill adds $500,000 in funding to the Department of Workforce Development programs for local youth apprenticeship grants.
"Our youth deserve access to the best education and training we can provide," Governor Walker said. "Most manufacturing careers require more than a high school degree, and this bill helps an additional 555 participants a year, begin training for skilled, family-supporting careers. I thank Senator Sheila Harsdorf (R-River Falls) and Representative Lee Nerison (R-Westby) for their leadership on this bill."
Senate Bill 336 is one of the eight Worker Training initiatives introduced by Governor Walker this fall. The Worker Training initiatives aim to get workers the skills they need to succeed in the current workplace and into the future. Youth are able to receive on-the-job training through apprenticeships, which are a nationally-recognized strategy of preparing the next generation of workers. Last year, 210 school districts participated in the program and 81 percent of the program graduates received job offers with the employer who provided the training.
The bill, which is Act 112, had broad bipartisan support, passing the Senate on a voice vote, and passing the Assembly with a 94-1 vote.
