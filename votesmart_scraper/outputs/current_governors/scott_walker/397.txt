Location: Waukesha, WI

Governor Scott Walker joined students as a guest reader today at La Casa de Esperanza in Waukesha. He read the children's book Chicka Chicka Boom Boom by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault.
"Every child should have access to a quality education regardless of their zip code, which is why we have worked to expand education options for parents and students," said Governor Walker. "It was great to talk with and listen to the students and teachers at La Casa de Esperanza, a new charter school in Waukesha. This is an example of parents choosing the best option for their children, be it a traditional public school, charter school, virtual school, or home school. We will continue our work to expand and transform education for families across the state."
