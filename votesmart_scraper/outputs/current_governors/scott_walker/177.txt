Governor Scott Walker announced the appointments of Judge Mac Davis and Judge Robert Kinney to the newly created Ethics Commission today. Davis is the Wisconsin Legislature's majority party nominee, and Kinney is the minority party nominee.
Judge Mac Davis, currently retired, received his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1976 and entered private practice until his election to the Waukesha County Circuit Court in 1990. Davis also served in the Wisconsin State Senate from 1983 until 1990. He was nominated to the federal judiciary by George W. Bush in 2008, but the Democratic-controlled Senate refused to consider his appointment.
Judge Robert Kinney currently serves as a reserve judge for the State of Wisconsin, as well as an appointed referee for the Office of Lawyer Regulation. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1971 and began his public service as the Assistant District Attorney for Marathon County shortly after.
Both majority and minority party leadership submitted three names each. Two of the minority party's nominees withdrew their names from consideration.
The Ethics Commission also includes Katie McCallum, Peg Lautenschlager, Pat Strachota, and David Halbrooks.
