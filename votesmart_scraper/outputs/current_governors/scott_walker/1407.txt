Governor Walker Announces Reading Task Force: "Read to Lead"
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: March 31, 2011
Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker issued Executive Order #22 today announcing a bold education reform initiative to ensure that every Wisconsin child learns to read by the third grade. "Read to Lead" will empower teachers, districts, and parents to decide how to best teach reading at home and in the classroom.
"As it stands today, nearly one third of all Wisconsin students cannot read at a third grade level, and that is simply unacceptable," Governor Scott Walker said. "This initiative's sole focus will be to ensure that every Wisconsin student can read proficiently by the end of the third grade so that they have the opportunity to succeed."
Governor Walker's "Read to Lead" Task Force will be comprised of the following 14 members from diverse backgrounds (current and former teachers, researchers, legislators, and advocates). These members will guide future legislation that will focus more on results and less on government mandates.
* Governor Scott Walker, Chair
* Superintendent Tony Evers, Department of Public Instruction
* Senator Luther Olsen
* Representative Steve Kestell
* Representative Jason Fields
* Steve Dykstra, Wisconsin Reading Coalition
* Past President Marcia Henry, International Dyslexia Association
* Michele Erikson, Wisconsin Literacy
* Kathy Champeau, Wisconsin State Reading Association and former MPS teacher
* Author Tony Pedriana, Leaving Johnny Behind (2010)
* Mara Brown, Jefferson Elementary School teacher (Oshkosh)
* Mary Read, Greater Milwaukee Foundation
* Linda Pils, 25 years in Madison & Middleton as a K-2 teacher, Rowland Reading Foundations
* Rachel Lander -- University of Wisconsin-Madison (Value Added Research Center)
Governor Walker's guidelines for the "Read to Lead" initiative:
路 While any accountability measure must enforce basic standards, all promotion decisions must be made in concert with teachers and parents. Any proposal must encourage parental involvement to the greatest degree possible and must ultimately be designed with the interests of children in mind.
路 A student must be given multiple opportunities on a number of different assessments to prove he or she can read before being non-promoted. A child will not be held back based simply on the results of one high-stakes test.
路 There must be a limit on how many times a student can be held back. No student will be held in third grade indefinitely.
路 Any retention policy must have a delayed trigger so no student is retained who has not had the benefit of being in the new system for multiple years.
By the time a student reaches the fourth grade, s/he is no longer learning to read, but instead is reading to learn.
