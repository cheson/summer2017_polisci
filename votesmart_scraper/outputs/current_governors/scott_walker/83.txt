Statement
By: Scott Walker

Location: Madison, WI

Governor Scott Walker called the Wisconsin State Legislature into special session and issued new directives to state agencies today in a continuation of the fight against the heroin and opioid epidemic. The special session call and agency directives were given through Executive Orders #228, #229, and #230. The orders implement recommendations made in a report issued today by Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch and Representative John Nygren, co-chairs of the Governor's Task Force on Opioid Abuse.
"This is a public health crisis, and that's why I'm calling a special session of the Legislature and directing state agencies to ramp up the state's response," said Governor Walker. "I thank Lieutenant Governor Kleefisch and Representative Nygren for making these recommendations, the work of the task force, and the many first responders, medical professionals, and family members who are on the front lines of this effort."
