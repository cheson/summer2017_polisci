Hi, Scott Walker here.
Access to high-speed internet connections is something I've worked on for years. In 2011, we created the new Broadband Expansion Grant Program. There wasn't a program like that until we took office, and a year ago, we worked with lawmakers to triple the amount of funding for these grants. Looking ahead, we will expand the program even more so we can connect every part of the State of Wisconsin.
In addition, we just launched Broadband Forward! -- a community certification program offered by the Public Service Commission.
This jump-starts broadband expansion in Wisconsin by eliminating obstacles to infrastructure improvements and by streamlining the process for approving local broadband investment.
Access to high-speed internet connections makes it easier for people to find work, encourages our businesses to grow, promotes tourism, and improves the quality of education for our students.
To compete in the global economy, it is crucial that Wisconsin's small businesses, schools, and households have fast, reliable internet access. The Broadband Forward! Community Certification Program helps expand broadband access throughout the state. We will not stop until every part of Wisconsin is connected and moving forward.
