Governor Scott Walker presented the Life Saving award to a Department of Natural Resources conservation warden today. Warden Lance Burns was recognized for his actions to rescue citizens from the path of the fast-moving Germann Road wildfire in Bayfield and Douglas counties last month.
"Thank you to all of the emergency responders, who answered the call, when the Germann Road fire erupted on May 14th," Governor Walker said. "These men and women worked quickly and efficiently to save lives and to contain the massive fire. Warden Burns made a special point of getting to a resident whom he knew lived alone and whose worst fear was fire."
The resident who was saved had fallen asleep due to her medical condition and was awakened by loud pounding on her front door.
"Warden Burns had the resident and her cat into her truck and on the way out of the area when the fire neared her property," Governor Walker added. "Warden Burns represents the work ethic and the caring nature of Wisconsinites."
The Governor also congratulated the 25 members of the academy class, who completed 13 to 15 weeks of training at the DNR Warden Academy at Fort McCoy.
"Wisconsin's conservation wardens are among the most extensively trained law enforcement officers in the nation," said Governor Walker. "Their primary responsibility is to protect the great natural resources of our state and the people, who enjoy them. We are very proud of these public servants."
