Location: Wausau, WI

Governor Scott Walker traveled to G.D. Jones Elementary School in Wausau today to highlight the crucial funding provided to K-12 and rural schools under his budget proposal that is not included in the Assembly's proposal.
"Our K-12 budget proposal makes historic investments thanks to the Reform Dividend," Governor Walker said. "By investing more than $11.5 billion this budget in public education -- without raising property taxes on the hard-working Wisconsin taxpayers -- we are helping prepare all students for success."
The Wausau School District is estimated to receive $124.6 million in funding from the state under Governor Walker's biennial budget, including:
An increase of more than $4.9 million in Per Pupil Aid. Governor Walker's budget proposal increases per-pupil funding by $200 per pupil in Fiscal Year 2018 and $204 per pupil in Fiscal Year 2019 -- the largest increase since the 2005-2007 biennium.
Under the Assembly's K-12 education proposal, the Wausau School District would receive $875,056 less in Per Pupil Aid and pay $31,727 more to other school districts in open enrollment. The total loss would be $906,783 over the biennium when compared to Governor Walker's proposal.
In addition, Governor Walker highlighted the positive impact his rural school initiative will have on local school districts if the Legislature passes his proposal.
"We know Wisconsin's rural schools face many unique challenges when it comes to providing the students in their districts with a quality education," Governor Walker added. "Our budget proposal takes this into account and provides greater state support for rural schools across the board. In fact, here in the Wausau area, the additional support we provide in the form of Sparsity Aid would significantly benefit local school districts."
Under Governor Walker's K-12 education proposal, Sparsity Aid provides $300 per pupil of additional funding to small rural districts that have less than 745 pupils and a population density of fewer than 10 pupils per square mile of district attendance. The Governor's proposal also creates a $100 per pupil tier of Sparsity Aid funding for districts with 746-1000 pupils, which provides additional stability for school districts that hover around the 745 buffer.
Governor Walker highlighted his increases to Sparsity Aid that uniquely benefit rural schools in the area, including:
Edgar -- $130,200
Pittsville -- $117,400
Athens -- $84,200
Minocqua J1 -- $109,800
Wabeno -- 84,000
Lac du Flambeau -- $106,600
North Lakeland -- $27,400
Phelps -- $31,800
Woodruff -- $88,400
Laona -- $44,200
Lakeland UHS -- $139,800
Marathon City -- $131,000
Prentice -- $85,600
Chequamegon -- $145,200
