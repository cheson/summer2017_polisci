Governor Scott Walker congratulated the Wilmot Union High School (WUHS) Academic Decathlon team today for winning the Division II National Championship and their third consecutive state title. Governor Walker also proclaimed today, June 1, 2016, as Wilmot Union High School Academic Decathlon Team Day throughout the state.
"The student members of the Wilmot Union High School Academic Decathlon team have demonstrated incredible dedication and academic rigor in their preparations and performance at the Division II National Championship," Governor Walker said. "They've represented the state of Wisconsin well at the competition, collecting more than 40 medals and contributing a total of 47,606 points out of a possible 60,000. Our congratulations to the team for this tremendous academic achievement and we look forward to seeing what these talented individuals accomplish in the future."
The Academic Decathlon requires student participants to master ten different skills and disciplines and follows the same multidisciplinary format at every level of the competition. Decathletes participate in the following five types of events:
SuperQuiz -- Decathletes take turns solving tough multiple choice challenges in front of a national audience;
Speech -- Decathletes speak for up to four minutes on a topic of their choice;
Interview --Decathletes have seven minutes to answer questions about their background, interests, and goals;
Essay -- Decathletes have 50 minutes to write the strongest paper possible; and
Tests of Knowledge -- Decathletes complete seven multiple choice exams, one in each of the Academic Decathlon subjects: Art, Music, Social Science, Science, Economics, Language and Literature, and Mathematics.
The WUHS Academic Decathlon team consists of nine students and Social Studies teacher, Don Serkowski, has coached the team for the last 14 years. The team has won the state Academic Decathlon for the previous three years and in 2016, beat out 20 teams from around the state and broke a 27-year state record in the reading and literature test.
