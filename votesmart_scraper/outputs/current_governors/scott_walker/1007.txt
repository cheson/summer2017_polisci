Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
Freedom. Endowed by our Creator. Defined by our Constitution. And defended each and every day by the men and women who wear the uniform of these United States of America.
This week is Armed Forces Week, and it's my honor to thank our military personnel, their families, and all veterans for their commitment to our state and to our country. We can never say thank you enough.
It's also a great time to encourage employers in our state to hire a returning veteran. Not only is it patriotic to hire a vet, it makes good business sense as they are well trained, disciplined, and devoted. And with the Wisconsin GI Bill, they now have free access to higher education in the state.
Please join me this week in thanking all who serve, and those who served before them. Thank you.
