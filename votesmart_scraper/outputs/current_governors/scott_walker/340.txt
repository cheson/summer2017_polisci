Hi, Scott Walker here.
Ringing in the New Year is an exciting time filled with new beginnings, as well as reflections of the past year.
In 2015, we made great strides for the hard-working families of Wisconsin.
For starters, more people are working in Wisconsin. Our unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since the spring of 2001 and our labor participation rate is five points higher than the national average.
Property taxes in Wisconsin are lower than they were five years ago on a median valued home and middle class taxpayers are feeling relief with lower state income taxes.
This year, we continued our work to make college more affordable for students and working families in Wisconsin by extending our tuition freeze at all UW campuses for a total of four years in a row.
We have spent the year working hard to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to live their piece of the American Dream and our work is not over yet.
Wisconsin's future is bright and we are looking forward to a very prosperous 2016. We wish all of Wisconsin a happy, healthy and safe new year.
