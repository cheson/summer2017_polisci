Governor Walker issued the following statement today about the state's latest revenue projections and the opportunity to pay off many of the financial obligations left behind by the Doyle administration.
"The revenue numbers released today are the latest sign that the economy is improving and Wisconsin is on the right track. When we took office we said we would Open Wisconsin for Business and our top priority would be creating jobs. Since day one, we have been passing the most aggressive pro-jobs legislation in the nation. Last week, CEO's from across the country noted Wisconsin's turnaround and we saw a bigger improvement in our business ranking than any other state.
In the first three months of the year we've seen the private sector create 24,000 jobs, including more than 11,000 manufacturing jobs. We've also been able to maintain our bond rating without tax increases by introducing a credit positive budget. It's important that we use this additional revenue to continue the sound financial stewardship that is encouraging economic growth. Just like Wisconsin families our first priority is to payoff past due bills and debts. I look forward to working with the legislature to continue making the responsible financial decisions that encourages long-term economic growth."
