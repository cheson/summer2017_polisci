Governor Scott Walker joined local officials and legislators this afternoon at the Beloit Public Library to highlight the importance of literacy for the future success of Wisconsin's youth, as well as the numerous resources the state's libraries provide to citizens of all ages.
"Wisconsin's libraries serve as crucial tools for the citizens of our state," Governor Walker said. "They are an excellent resource for those learning how to read and help to spark a lifelong love of reading and learning. They also serve citizens of our state seeking to sharpen their career skills, change careers, apply for jobs, or even file their taxes."
Governor Walker's 2015-17 biennial budget allocated Wisconsin's public library system $30,026,200 in state aid. Wisconsin boasts 382 public library and 82 public library branches and in 2015, the state's public libraries hosted nearly 100,000 programs for Wisconsinites of all ages.
"Our libraries truly have the power to transform our communities," Governor Walker added. "They contain a wealth of knowledge and support, all of which is readily accessible to the citizens of Wisconsin."
