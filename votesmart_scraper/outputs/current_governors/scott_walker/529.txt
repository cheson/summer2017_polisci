Hi, this is Governor Scott Walker.
Earlier this year, we announced our plan to merge state agencies and services in order to make government more effective, more efficient, and more accountable to the public. This is part of our efforts to reduce the size and scope of government here in Wisconsin.
Creating the Forward Wisconsin Development Authority will guarantee efficiency and sharpen our focus on economic development and job creation. This will also allow for greater collaboration at the grassroots level with local, regional, and private sector partners to cultivate and grow our economy.
We also propose creating the Department of Financial Institutions and Professional Standards in order to improve services and efficiently certify businesses and professionals who want to operate in our state.
We want a government that taxpayers can afford. These, among other consolidations, will help us achieve a more efficient government that will contribute to a higher standard of living for our state residents and greater overall economic growth.
