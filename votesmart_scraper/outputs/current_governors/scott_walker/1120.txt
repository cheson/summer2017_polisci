Governor Walker Requests SBA Disaster Declaration for Flood Victims of Douglas County
Press Release
By: Scott Walker
Date: July 26, 2012
Location: Madison, WI

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker requested the Small Business Administration (SBA) declare Douglas County a disaster area due to damages incurred by June flooding.
"This declaration would allow individuals affected by the flooding to apply for low-interest loans," Governor Walker said. "This option would help in the recovery by allowing people to begin much-needed renovations."
On June 19-20, a severe thunderstorm dropped eight to ten inches of rain over the county, resulting in flash flooding causing significant damage to homes and businesses in Douglas County. The Douglas County Emergency Management, Wisconsin Emergency Management, and a representative from the Small Business Administration completed initial damage assessments and report more than twenty-five residences and businesses sustained significant damage and uninsured losses in excess of forty percent.
Damages to residences and businesses did not meet requirements for a major disaster declaration; therefore, Governor Walker is seeking assistance from the Small Business Administration.
