Hi, I'm Scott Walker.
On Monday, Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch and members of my Cabinet joined me at Modine Manufacturing Company in Racine to kickoff our "Cabinet on the Road." The purpose of this new initiative is to listen to the concerns of local job creators and their partners to determine how we can help them create more jobs and achieve further success in Wisconsin.
These sessions are also an excellent opportunity for Cabinet members and me to ask questions about the impact state government has on the private sector. We must continue to do all that we can to lower the cost of doing business in our state so job creators can grow and hire more workers.
The first "Cabinet on the Road" in Racine was the first of multiple stops, and I look forward to future events listening to job creators and economic development specialists all across Wisconsin.
In other exciting news for the state, Chief Executive magazine announced that Wisconsin now ranks 17th on the annual "Best/Worst States for Business" survey. This is the third consecutive year Wisconsin improved its position among the states best for business. Wisconsin improved three places from 2012, where we were 20th, and it recently saw the largest gain of any state in the survey's history, moving 17 places from the bottom ten, 41st in 2010 to 24th in 2011.
Since taking office in 2011, my number one goal has been to help the private sector create jobs by establishing a favorable climate to show our economy is better off than it was just a few years ago. The survey shows we're on the right track to becoming one of America's best states for business and ultimately for jobs.
