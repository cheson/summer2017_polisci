Hi, Scott Walker here.
Here in Wisconsin, we have some great national sports teams, including the Green Bay Packers, the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Milwaukee Bucks.
But the future of the Bucks in Milwaukee is in jeopardy. If a new arena is not built by 2017, the NBA will buy the Bucks back from the new owners and move the team to another state.
We know that many of you -- particularly outside of Milwaukee - may not go to Bucks games or even have plans to go to Bucks games in the future and therefore you may not want the state involved in any efforts to keep the Bucks here. After all, you might say, there are plenty of other areas we need to spend money on -- like education and health care.
We hear your concerns -- and that's why we took a long, hard look at the financial impact of investing to keep the Bucks here or just letting them go. The bottom line is, it's cheaper to keep them.
You probably already know this -- but NBA players make a lot of money, and every time they play here in Wisconsin, we get a piece of that through state income taxes, from both home AND away players. That really adds up, especially combined with other revenues an NBA team brings to the state.
Should the Bucks leave, taxpayers would lose an estimated $419 million over the next 20 years. Of that, $299 million is just in the income tax collections alone over the next 20 years. To keep them here, the state contribution for a new arena is capped at $4 million a year, or $80 million over 20 years.
