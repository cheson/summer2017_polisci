Governor Scott Walker was in Altoona Tuesday to announce a grant that he says will create more jobs.
The governor visited Curt Manufacturing Tuesday afternoon. He says the Transportation Economic Assistance grant worth $625,000 will help Curt Manufacturing expand its existing facility in Altoona. He says the project will directly create 125 jobs and indirectly create 129 jobs.
Walker says "This will help them minimize the cost to the city and because we think there will be an impact far beyond here to the Chippewa Valley, and ultimately to the state of Wisconsin."
Curt Manufacturing is designing and reconstructing a portion of US 12 and the intersection with Eau Claire County to improve access to the firm's expanded facilities.
