Last night the Legislature passed Senate Bill 368, which reforms Wisconsin's wetland regulations.
"I support updating regulations related to wetlands, and specifically looking at balancing the need for economic growth with the need to protect Wisconsin's pristine natural resources," said Governor Walker. "I would like to thank State Senator Neal Kedzie and Representative Jeff Mursau for providing leadership on this issue. I look forward to signing this bill into law and working with the Department of Natural Resources to implement this pro-growth, pro-environment piece of legislation."
