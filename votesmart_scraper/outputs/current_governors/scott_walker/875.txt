A Record of Fighting for Veterans
"The freedoms we hold dear were endowed by our Creator and upheld by our constitution but it is the members of our Armed Forces -- past and present -- who protect those freedoms each day. We are eternally grateful." -- Scott Walker
Since the Civil War, Wisconsin has thanked the men and women who serve our country and ensured that when they returned from combat, they returned to open arms both at home and from their state government. As governor, I have continued Wisconsin's tradition of honoring our veterans, and will keep our promise to those who have served our state and country.
It is time to return Wisconsin to its roots of honoring the men and women who served, and thanking their families who provide love and support in trying times.
This is why as governor my priority has been putting the needs of Wisconsin's veterans ahead of politics and petty partisan differences.
