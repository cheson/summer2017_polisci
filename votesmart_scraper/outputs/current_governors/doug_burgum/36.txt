Burgum Comes Out On Top, Pledges To Unite Republican party

BISMARCK -- Fargo entrepreneur Doug Burgum stunned the GOP establishment Tuesday with a convincing win over the party's endorsed candidate, Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem, an improbable victory after trailing by nearly 50 points in a poll less than four months ago.
With 389 of 432 precincts reporting, the millionaire former Microsoft executive held a 60 percent to 38 percent lead over Stenehjem, with Bismarck oilfield consultant Paul Sorum a distant third at less than 2 percent. Complete results were not available at press time.
Burgum now emerges as the favorite in November in a state where Republicans hold every statewide elected office and voters haven't picked a Democrat for governor since 1988.
He told supporters in Fargo that he would work to heal the wounds of a hard-fought campaign.
"Now with the primary completed it's time for us to come together as Republicans, and I'm committed to unite the Republican Party," he said, as the crowd cheered.
Burgum said he would get in touch with Gov. Jack Dalrymple as well as legislative leaders to work on the transition and to address the fiscal challenges facing North Dakota, which has struggled in recent years with low farm and oil prices.
The entrepreneur-turned-politician promised a vigorous campaign with running mate Brent Sanford over the next five months, and said he was proud to continue a tradition of North Dakota businessmen whose first elective office was governor, joining Ed Schafer and John Hoeven. Schafer, in fact, broke ranks with the party establishment and endorsed Burgum last week, a helping hand Burgum acknowledged in his speech.
