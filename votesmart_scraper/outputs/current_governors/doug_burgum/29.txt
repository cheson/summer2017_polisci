"To create a 21st century economy, we need to build on three pillars of economic success: a skilled workforce; smart, efficient infrastructure; and healthy, vibrant communities. By reinventing education, we will create a skilled workforce that matches the high-paying jobs of today and tomorrow. Utilizing our current infrastructure to its fullest potential, we can reduce the cost of local government and create vibrant, healthy cities. With your help, the Main Street Initiative will revitalize communities across our state and help keep North Dakota exceptional."
Three Pillars Of Economic Success:
A Skilled Workforce; Smart, Efficient Infrastructure; &
Healthy, Vibrant Communities
It is time for all of us to become active members of our communities and engage in dialogue about how to create better cities for ourselves and our children, how to support innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic diversity, and how we can work together to ensure that North Dakota can compete and thrive in an ever-changing and increasingly competitive global economy.
The Main Street Initiative was built on a foundation of values: respect for the past, gratitude for the present, and inspiration for the future. By focusing our efforts on creating vibrant main streets with smart infrastructure, we will attract and retain a skilled workforce and realize our full potential as a state.
