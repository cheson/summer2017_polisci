The Main Street Initiative is about creating attractive, healthy and economically sound communities that will attract and retain the entrepreneurs, innovators, and skilled workforce needed in a 21st century economy. By investing in smart, efficient infrastructure, and creating vibrant, walkable main streets, we will create communities in which our children and grandchildren will thrive.
To realize our full potential as a state, we must create the jobs, the workforce and the communities that are equipped to take advantage of the opportunities that a 21st century economy provides. The Main Street Initiative, along with entrepreneurs, innovators, and committed local leaders, will be a catalyst of inspiration and action to build these vibrant communities.
