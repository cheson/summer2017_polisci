Press Release

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued this statement following the announcement from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment that Colorado's unemployment rate dropped to 4.1 percent in November. The national unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.8 percent.

"While economic growth continues in Colorado and our unemployment rate continues to drop, we know we still have much to do," Hickenlooper said. "We are focused on seizing this momentum and finding creative and effective ideas that will help support those still looking for work and Coloradans who are working hard but not making ends meet."

The last time the Colorado unemployment rate was as low as 4.1 percent was January 2008, four months prior to the pre-recession jobs peak reached in May 2008.
