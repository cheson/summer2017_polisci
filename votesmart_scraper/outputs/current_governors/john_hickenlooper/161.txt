Statement

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement about Colorado's selection in the President's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) through the new Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI):

"We are delighted that Colorado is one of the six member states of the institute, and will soon be home to one of the three new facilities. The integration of our regional and industry planning efforts through the Colorado Blueprint has afforded us the opportunity to leverage federal initiatives such as this. With today's announcement, we successfully reached another goal - to accelerate our state's advanced industries. While work at our location will focus on the wind energy industry, it will create the technology infrastructure needed to fuel growth in other industries."
"None of this would be possible without the commitment, collaboration and partnership between the state, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado Advanced Manufacturing Alliance, Colorado School of Mines, University of Colorado and Colorado State University, as well as industry and business leaders across the state," said Hickenlooper.
