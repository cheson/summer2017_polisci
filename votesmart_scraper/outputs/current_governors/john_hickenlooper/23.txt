Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision against reimbursing private businesses and individuals for claims of damages from the Gold King Mine spill:

The Attorney General has agreed to help us find ways we can make sure our residents receive just compensation."
