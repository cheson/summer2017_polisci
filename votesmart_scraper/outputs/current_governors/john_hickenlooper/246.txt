Location: Denver, CO

Tonight, Governor John Hickenlooper offered the following statement on the announcement that Bob Beauprez had won the Republican primary campaign.
"I congratulate Congressman Beauprez and look forward to a positive
conversation about the future of our state," he said. "Over the past four years
we've seen Colorado go from 40th to fourth in job creation, and we've seen
unemployment drop from 9 percent to 5.8 percent. We're committed to keeping
that positive momentum going until Colorado is number one in the country for
job creation."
Since taking office in 2011, the Hickenlooper administration has made job creation in
Colorado its top priority, and has achieved success by bringing Republicans,
Independents and Democrats together in the shared mission of economic development.
