Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia issued the following statement as the Colorado Measures of Academic Success (CMAS) tests began statewide today:
"We're all working to make sure that Colorado's schools are inclusive and provide a world-class education for every student. These assessments help us to see if we are meeting the high standards we have set for ourselves in Colorado. Opting out just makes this work harder.
With full participation, we can ensure that every student gets a great education. We can ensure teachers and other educators get the credit they deserve for their incredible efforts. That's why I'm urging students to take the test and that's why I'm asking parents to encourage their kids to participate."
