Gov. John Hickenlooper announced today that Colorado will receive $56.9 million from the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program to support continuing flood recovery efforts. The funding specifically targets ongoing conservation work and watershed projects following the 2013 floods.

"With the support of our federal partners, and the ongoing resiliency and strength of so many Coloradans, we continue to make progress on rebuilding," said Hickenlooper. "The 2013 flood was unique not just in size but because of the impact it had on the watersheds and stream corridors, which tie our communities, wildlife and natural areas together. These funds will help restore those connections damaged in the floods that are vital to Colorado's environment and our way of life."

This is the second investment by the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Colorado's recovery efforts. In 2013, NRCS awarded nearly $13 million to restore watershed and protect homes and infrastructure from further flooding. Today's award of $56.9 million is the second phase to help restore stream corridors, remove debris and prevent future flooding. Work will target about 500 sites in the flood impacted area.

Hickenlooper joined Senator Michael Bennet and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to advocate on behalf of flood impacted Coloradans to ensure this funding would come to Colorado to help severely impacted watersheds. The state will work with NRCS to get this funding to impacted communities as efficiently as possible.
