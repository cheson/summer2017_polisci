Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: April 4, 2013
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced the Colorado Department of Corrections will review records to ensure offenders are serving appropriate sentences. Also, the National Institute of Corrections will conduct a review of the department's parole operations.

"We asked the Department of Corrections to review its internal procedures and initiate an audit of the time and release records," Hickenlooper said. "The department will prioritize the review of cases with the greatest level of risk, going back 10 years and reviewing required consecutive sentencing. The department will work with the Attorney General's office on any issues that may need further action."

Hickenlooper ordered the review on Tuesday, April 2. The Governor's Office and Department of Corrections have worked this week and will work through the weekend to put together a plan to request additional resources for the department to complete the review.

This review and audit will help to ensure that resources are appropriately prioritized and utilized to maximize public safety.
