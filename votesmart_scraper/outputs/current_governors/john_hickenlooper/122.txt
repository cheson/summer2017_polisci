Gov. John Hickenlooper announced today the appointment of Judge Richard Lance Gabriel to the Colorado Supreme Court. Gabriel will replace Supreme Court Justice Gregory J. Hobbs, Jr., who is retiring September 1, 2015, after serving on the Supreme Court since 1996.
"Richard Gabriel has been unfailingly dedicated to the law, community and his family," Hickenlooper said. "He brings a strong background in commercial litigation and business law, which has been underrepresented on the Court. He's currently a bright star on the Colorado Court of Appeals and will be an exceptional member of the Colorado Supreme Court."
Gabriel is the 104th person in the state's history to be appointed to the Colorado Supreme Court.
Gabriel is currently serving as a judge on the Colorado Court of Appeals. Prior to becoming a judge in 2008, Gabriel was an associate and partner at Holme, Roberts & Owen LLP (now Bryan Cave LLP). In private practice, Mr. Gabriel specialized in general complex and commercial litigation, including business torts, intellectual property, products liability, probate litigation, and appeals. He also was an associate at Shea & Gould in New York City and served as a law clerk to the Honorable J. Frederick Motz of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.
Gabriel earned his undergraduate degree from Yale University and his Juris Doctor from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law.
