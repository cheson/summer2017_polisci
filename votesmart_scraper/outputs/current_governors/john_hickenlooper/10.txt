Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on the Martinez Case
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: May 18, 2017
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement:
We notified the Attorney General that we did not want to pursue an appeal of the Martinez case. We believe that the statute governing the commission's powers does not include the authority to initiate an appeal in this case. However, the Attorney General reached a different legal conclusion. While we understand and respect the commission's desire for further clarity from the Supreme Court, we believe the court of appeals' decision does not represent a significant departure from the commission's current approach. The commission already elevates public health and environmental concerns when considering regulating oil and gas operations.
