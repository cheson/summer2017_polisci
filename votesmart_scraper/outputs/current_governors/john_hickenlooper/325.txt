Gov. John Hickenlooper joined Senate President John Morse and House Speaker Mark Ferrandino in a letter to ask the Colorado Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice to assess Colorado's current criminal laws applicable to sexual offenders to determine whether the passage of provisions in "Jessica's Law" would improve these laws.

"In recent weeks we have received various requests to consider legislation similar to the Jessica Lunsford Act, known as "Jessica's Law,' enacted in Florida in 2005 in response to the tragic abduction, sexual assault and murder of nine year old Jessica Marie Lunsford," the letter says. "In response to these requests, we believe it is in the best interest of Colorado to thoroughly review the impacts the law's enactment would have on our state."
