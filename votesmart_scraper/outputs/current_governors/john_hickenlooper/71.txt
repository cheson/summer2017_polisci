Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced they proposed adding the Bonita Peak Mining District to the National Priorities List, making it eligible for additional study and cleanup resources under EPA's Superfund program.
"We are pleased the EPA proposed adding the Bonita Peak Mining District to the National Priorities List (NPL). This is a crucial next step in making the region eligible for necessary resources and comprehensive cleanup efforts under EPA's Superfund program, but our work is not done. We are working with the EPA to ensure that adequate funding for this site is provided, including immediate interim measures and options to mitigate any further water quality deterioration. We are also working to ensure state and local officials continue to have an active role and that there is robust and significant community involvement."
"Lastly, we continue to support efforts by our Congressional delegation to reach consensus around "Good Samaritan' legislation, which is one of the most significant tools at our disposal to allow for voluntary cleanups of draining and abandoned mines."
