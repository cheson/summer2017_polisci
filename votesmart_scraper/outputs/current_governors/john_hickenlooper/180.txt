Public Statements
Hickenlooper and Garcia Get Out the Vote in Colorado Springs Today
Press Release
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: Nov. 1, 2014
Location: Colorado Springs, CO

Today, Governor John Hickenlooper and Lt. Governor Joe Garcia joined community members at several Colorado Springs canvass kickoffs and the Phantom Canyon Brewing Co. to help Colorado Get Out The Vote. These were a few of the many statewide stops that the #Hicktory 2014! campaign tour has been making to urge Colorado voters to fill out and return their ballots.
"Over the last four years, we have worked together to grow our state's economy, which has resulted in 35 straight months of job creation and reducing unemployment to 4.7%," said Hickenlooper. "But there's more work to do to expand our economy, strengthen our public schools, diversify our energy portfolio and find bipartisan, common-sense solutions to issues that Coloradans care about. There are clear differences between my opponent and me on the issues. With Colorado Springs' support, we'll keep moving Colorado up."
