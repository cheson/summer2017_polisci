Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement on Thursday's accident at an oil and gas site in Mead, Colo:
"Today is about the victims and families of the Mead accident. It's a terrible tragedy and our hearts and prayers are with them and the entire Mead community. Our state agencies are in constant contact with local authorities and have offered our full assistance and resources. We certainly recognize the safety concerns raised given the recent home explosion in Firestone, but at this time we have no reason to believe that there is any relationship between the circumstances that led to these two accidents. It is important to note that this was a workplace incident that also will be investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Our number one priority is public safety. We will continue to work closely with investigating agencies and the industry to better understand the cause of this accident and take any necessary action to ensure that this doesn't happen again."
