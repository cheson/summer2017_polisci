Gov. John Hickenlooper is asking Coloradans to join people in Connecticut and across the country in a moment of silence to be observed at 9:30 a.m. MST on Friday, Dec. 21, in memory of the 26 people killed last week at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy asked all governors this week to have their states join the people of Connecticut in observing the moment of silence at 9:30 a.m., in their respective time zones. Malloy declared Friday a "Day of Mourning" in Connecticut.

"Too often, we focus on what divides us as people, instead of what binds us together as human beings," Malloy wrote in a letter to governors. "The sense of community that has emerged in the wake of this tragedy should not be lost as we begin to emerge from this national tragedy, and I ask you to join with me and the citizens of Connecticut to remember the loved ones lost last Friday."

Malloy also asked places of worship and government buildings in Connecticut to ring bells 26 times in honor of each person who died at the school. Hickenlooper encourages Colorado facilities to do the same if they have the capability.
