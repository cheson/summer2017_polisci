Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced he will join Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin to announce the results of a multistate solicitation designed to encourage auto manufacturers in the U.S. to develop more functional and affordable compressed natural gas vehicles. Fallin and Hickenlooper are leading a bipartisan group of 22 states seeking to use CNG vehicles in their state automobile fleets.

Fallin and Hickenlooper will announce the preliminary results of that effort at the Governor's Energy Conference held at the Cox Convention Center in Oklahoma City on Thursday, Oct. 4.
Earlier this year, both governors travelled to Detroit to meet with automakers about the project. In July, the states issued a request for proposal soliciting bids for compressed natural gas sedans, pickups and vans to be used in state fleets.
Hickenlooper said the multi-state project will add fuel diversity to the transportation sector. "Americans want more options when it comes to transportation fuels" Hickenlooper said. "Compressed natural gas is a technology that works today. It's clean, affordable, abundant and we produce it right here at home."

"What was originally an idea between two governors has grown into something very big," Fallin said. "With 22 states now participating, Gov. Hickenlooper and I are excited to be able to share what can be accomplished when politics are put aside and states work together. We believe that our CNG vehicle initiative will jump-start state use of CNG automobiles, save taxpayer dollars on fuel costs and help to support the use of an American-made fuel that supports American jobs."
