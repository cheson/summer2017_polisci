Gov. John Hickenlooper will join state employees from the Department of Local Affairs, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Safety, the Office of Emergency Management and other state agencies to recognize their flood recovery efforts at an employee appreciation event on Monday, Jan. 6, at History Colorado.

"We want to recognize the incredible efforts made by state employees from different agencies to help Coloradans recover from the historic September floods," Hickenlooper said. "Local communities have made quick and significant improvements that have allowed people to return to their homes and businesses. This would not have been possible without the coordination, innovation and plain hard work of state employees and the Colorado flood recovery team."
