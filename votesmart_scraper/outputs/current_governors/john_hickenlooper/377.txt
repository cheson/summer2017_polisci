BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
Thank you, Governor. Busy, busy times for you, I know. But there is this feeling, particularly as you get this one Colorado Springs fire under control that the worst is over s. That how you're feeling?
GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), COLORADO: We're certainly feeling that way. And now, we're beginning to look at how do we rebuild and begin the recovery. But we also know that Mother Nature will be fickle out here. So, we're keeping ourselves very alert.
CROWLEY: Governor, I know you have -- you have probably flown over a lot of these fires. I imagine you've visited scenes of the scenes of the destruction if you can get close to it. Just personally, can you give us through your eyes what you saw?
HICKENLOOPER: Well, it's been difficult. I mean, devastating that the Waldo fire in Colorado Springs, when we flew up there Tuesday night, and it was like your worst nightmare of a movie set of trying to show what the apocalypse or Armageddon would look like.
At first, from a distance, we flew on a helicopter in. This was as the fire was going on, this firestorm going on. And I thought it was trees burning. As we got closer, it was homes, basically almost 350 -- almost 350 homes burned in a couple of hours. It was that fast.
CROWLEY: Seven wildfires in all, I think. Are all of them under control? Are any of them out? Give us the kind of current situation.
HICKENLOOPER: Well, almost all are under control. We have one out in Grand Junction, and Western Colorado, that's not completely out of control.
