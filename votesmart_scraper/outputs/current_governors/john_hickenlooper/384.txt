Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed a bill that establishes criminal penalties for the illegal use of cathinones, also known as bath salts.

The bill, SB12-116, was sponsored by Sen. Joyce Foster and Rep. J. Paul Brown. It was one of several bills amended late in the legislative session onto HB12-1310, "Criminal Proceedings Omnibus Changes," sponsored by Sen. Morgan Carroll and Rep. Bob Gardner.

"We must work hard to keep these extremely dangerous and addictive drugs off the streets," Hickenlooper said. "We appreciate the speedy response by the General Assembly to pass this legislation this year."

The Criminal Proceedings Omnibus Changes bill was amended to several other bills, including:
* SB12-104, "Drug Treatment Fund Consolidation," sponsored by Rep. Brian DelGrosso and Sen. Pat Steadman
* SB12-163, "Reduce Penalty Certain Drug Possession Offenses," sponsored by Sens. Shawn Mitchell and Pat Steadman and Reps. Don Beezley and Claire Levy
* SB12-028, "Aggravated Juvenile Offenders," sponsored by Sen. Kevin Grantham and Rep. Mark Barker.
