Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: July 9, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement in support of the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act of 2015, a bill to ensure that legal marijuana businesses can access banking services. The bill was introduced by Colorado U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and Cory Gardner and Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).
"We applaud the leadership of Sens. Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, and our Colorado delegation of Sen. Michael Bennet and Sen. Cory Gardner, for joining Rep. Ed Perlmutter in tackling the public safety challenges embedded in a cash-heavy, state-legal marijuana system. America has historically relied on states to be laboratories of democracy. As marijuana is legalized in states across the country, the federal government has a duty to ensure that this experiment can proceed safely. That's why this bill is so important to Colorado: Providing marijuana businesses access to banking will protect the safety and well-being of our residents.
