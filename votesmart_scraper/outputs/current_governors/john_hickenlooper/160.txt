Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia, who also serves as executive director of the Colorado Department of Higher Education, said he is interested to learn more about President Obama's plan to make community college free for committed students. President Obama announced details of his plan, America's College Promise, today.

"We support the President's efforts to create more opportunities for students of all ages and stages in life to earn an associate's degree," Garcia said. "Community college is a great access point. An increasing number of jobs require a postsecondary credential, and job prospects can improve dramatically with an associate's degree depending upon the field of study."

In fact, the number one goal in Colorado's higher education master plan is to increase the number of Coloradans aged who hold high-quality postsecondary credentials - certificates and degrees - to 66 percent by 2025. Another key goal is to close the degree attainment gaps faced by underrepresented college students.

Garcia pointed out that Colorado already has an infrastructure in place to respond to President Obama's challenge. Several Colorado initiatives are aimed at achieving similar goals: making sure college is accessible, affordable, linked to workforce needs and accountable for timely degree completion.

Key Colorado initiatives include:
Â· Colorado Opportunity Scholarship Initiative: Gov. John Hickenlooper and Lt. Gov. Garcia recently announced the award of $3.4 million in grant funds to support Colorado students -- especially those from low-income and/or underrepresented backgrounds -- on the path to and through college and into the workforce. These grants will be leveraged with private funds.
