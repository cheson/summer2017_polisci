Gov. Hickenlooper Urges Voter Turnout in Recall Elections
Statement

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued a statement about the two recall elections scheduled for Sept. 10, 2013:

"Recall elections by their nature are divisive. That's all the more reason why voters should be given as much opportunity as possible to cast ballots in the coming days.

"Voting began in Pueblo County today and will include holiday and Sunday hours to give all eligible voters the opportunity to cast their ballots in a reasonable, convenient manner. Voting in El Paso County doesn't begin for another six days and includes only one weekend day before the election.

"We urge all eligible voters in Senate District 3 in Pueblo County and in Senate District 11 in El Paso County to go vote before or on Sept. 10. The more people who vote the better. Voting is, after all, one of the pillars of our democracy.

"When the elections are over, voters in these two senate districts should be able to agree that there was an open, fair process -- and that everyone was heard."
