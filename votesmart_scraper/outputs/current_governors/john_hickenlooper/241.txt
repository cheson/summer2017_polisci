Recovering from the recession is becoming a top priority for Western Slope and state political leaders with the area continuing to fall behind the Front Range economically.
"We don't always have the infrastructure," House District 57 Representative Bob Rankin said. "We don't have the airports. We don't have the roads. We don't have the railroads. We don't have the internet, broadband internet, infrastructure that we need, so we have to struggle."
Club 20 invited Governor John Hickenlooper for a round table discussion at Colorado Mountain College's Spring Valley campus Monday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
"I hope I'll personally be carrying some legislation that comes out of this meeting today so we can go forward and put new programs in place that really help Western Colorado," Representative Rankin said.
State and local representatives talked about how to boost the Western Slope economy by focusing on public lands, agritourism and internet broadband infrastructure.
"Broadband is something that levels the playing field and brings not only jobs but education and everything we need in rural Colorado," House District 58 Representative Don Coram said.
Club 20 is a group of politicians, business and community members from all of the Western Slope counties who coordinate events to keep the Western Slope's voice active in state politics.
