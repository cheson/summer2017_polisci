Gov. John Hickenlooper issued this statement tonight about Proposition AA:

"We are grateful voters approved funding that will allow for a strong regulatory environment, just like liquor is regulated. We will do everything in our power to make sure kids don't smoke pot and that we don't have people driving who are high. This ballot measure gives Colorado the ability to regulate marijuana properly."
