Gov. John Hickenlooper today released this statement about the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act:

"The court's decision simply keeps Colorado on the path toward reform we've been on since the Affordable Care Act became law. We must also remember that controlling costs across the entire health system is a critical component of expanding coverage. We remain committed to doing everything we can to improve the health and health care of all Coloradans."

The state of Colorado and the Colorado General Assembly began working in 2006 on a framework for improving health care outcomes for Coloradans. The Affordable Care Act helped build on the work of the state's Blue Ribbon Commission for Health Care Reform and provided increased funding to make comprehensive reform possible.

A number of important aspects of the law are already improving the lives of many Coloradans based on implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Colorado:

* 1,331 people with pre-existing conditions have received coverage through a new high risk pool, GettingUsCovered.
* 43,997 young adults in Colorado have gained insurance coverage.
* More than 380,000 seniors have taken advantage of preventative services -- such as mammograms and colonoscopies -- or a free annual wellness visit with their doctor.
* Nearly 1 million individuals in Colorado with private health insurance have gained preventive service coverage.
* Almost 2 million residents, including 696,000 women and 521,000 children, are free from worrying about lifetime limits on coverage -- freeing cancer patients and individuals suffering from other chronic diseases from having to worry about going without treatment.
* 40,000 people with Medicare in Colorado have received a $250 rebate and discounts to help cover the cost of their prescription drugs when they hit the Medicare coverage gap.

Last year, the Colorado legislature passed Senate Bill 200 with bi-partisan support, creating the Colorado Health Benefit Exchange. The legislation reflects the unique needs of Colorado, seeks Colorado-specific solutions and explores the maximum number of options available to the state in meeting the goals of quality access and affordability.

"More Coloradans will benefit when the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented in 2014," Hickenlooper said. "We will continue to operate within the law's framework and with the General Assembly while making state-level decisions that work for everybody."
