Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced Kurtis Morrison will be the next Director of Legislative Affairs for the governor's office.
Morrison is currently a member of the governor's senior leadership team serving as deputy legislative director and strategic adviser on transportation and infrastructure policy. He brings more than ten years of experience in public policy experience working with federal, state, and local governments.
"Kurt has a proven track record of navigating through complicated public policy issues with the General Assembly to help find the best solutions for Coloradans," Hickenlooper said. "He has provided steady counsel and his unique expertise throughout this past session and we look forward to working with him on the challenges ahead."
Morrison will help lead the administration's legislative agenda and will continue to work directly with members of the state legislature. He will also continue to work closely with the executive branch departments and coordinate efforts on their legislative agendas.
Before joining the governor's office, Morrison was the state and federal liaison/legislative counsel for the Colorado Department of Transportation where he advised the executive director and senior management team on public policy and legislation, and served as a resource to the General Assembly on transportation law. Earlier, he worked for the legislature's nonpartisan staff agency as the policy and committee staff for the House Committee on Transportation and Energy, and as a senior aide to a U.S. senator in Washington, D.C.
Morrison holds a bachelor's degree in Political Science from Creighton University, a master's degree from George Washington University, and a law degree from the University of Denver.
