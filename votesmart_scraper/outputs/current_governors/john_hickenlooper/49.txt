Gov. Hickenlooper Vetoes "Red Light Camera" Bill
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: June 2, 2016
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today vetoed House Bill 16-1231, "Concerning the Limited Use of Automated Vehicle Identification Systems Designed to Detect Disobedience to a Traffic Signal."
"Last year, we wrote to the General Assembly on several occasions in agreement that use of traffic photo-enforcement tools should be limited and used only in a manner that instills trust in government and confidence that public safety is paramount," said Hickenlooper.
"House Bill 16-1231 implements no such reasonable limitations. Rather, the bill enacts a State-imposed blanket ban on red light cameras for all municipalities, denying communities the right to decide for themselves based on their own traffic safety needs."
