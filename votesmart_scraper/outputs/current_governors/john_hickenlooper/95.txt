Gov. John Hickenlooper and a Colorado delegation of business and academic leaders will conclude a two week economic development and innovation trip with meetings in Israel. This includes stops at Tel Aviv University, the National Cyber Bureau, and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, where Hickenlooper helped ring the opening bell Monday morning.
The governor met with former President Shimon Peres, and today met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the promotion of trade relations and opportunities.
Hickenlooper also visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem, stating "Israel is a critical ally of the United States. Colorado has a long history of unwavering support for Israel. This is never going to change. In these difficult times we stand in solidarity with Israel. We wanted to demonstrate that Jerusalem, sacred to three of the world's great religions, is open and welcoming to people of all beliefs. We commend Israel for its commitment to protecting the holy places." Hickenlooper expressed hope that the Palestinian leadership help restore calm and put an end to the incitement.
Hickenlooper led the delegation on a four-country trip including Japan, China, Turkey as well as Israel to bolster global relationships, innovation ties and lead to Colorado jobs.
