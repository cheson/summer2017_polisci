Gov. Hickenlooper Statement on BLM, USFS Land Use Plans for Sage Grouse Conservation and Development
Statement

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement about the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) land use plans and their effect on sage grouse conservation and development:
"We're cautiously optimistic about the approach taken by the BLM and USFS in the land use plans announced today. Of course, these are significant documents and we need time to carefully read and review them to see how various concerns from cooperating agencies have been addressed. We've had a strong partnership with the Interior Department, and while we still have some difficulties with the BLM's approach, we remain committed to keep working through those issues.
We continue to believe state-led efforts are the best approach to protecting the greater sage grouse. The federal agencies rely heavily on regulatory mandates, but Colorado has found that incentive-based approaches in combination with regulation are the most effective. We've worked closely with many partners across the spectrum, including local governments, industry, landowners and conservationists. A federal approach that is too rigid, including a listing of the bird, puts that cooperation at risk. We'll continue to work with all parties to strike the right balance needed to protect this important species as well as Colorado livelihoods.
Secretary Jewell continues to be a valuable partner to Colorado and the western states, frequently visiting each of us to address endangered species issues. We look forward to continuing our work with her."
