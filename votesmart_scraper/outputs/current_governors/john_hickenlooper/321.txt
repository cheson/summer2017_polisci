Gov. John Hickenlooper today directed the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) to begin work on a draft Colorado Water Plan that will support agriculture in rural Colorado and align state policy to the state's water values.

"Colorado deserves a plan for its water future use that aligns the state's many and varied water efforts and streamlines the regulatory processes," Hickenlooper said. "We started this effort more than two years ago and are pleased to see another major step forward. We look forward to continuing to tap Colorado's collaborative and innovative spirit to address our water challenges."

An executive order signed by Hickenlooper directs the CWCB to utilize the work of the state's grassroots water process, the Basin Roundtables and Interbasin Compact Committee, in developing a draft report by December 2014. A final report should be completed one year later.

The Colorado Water Plan is necessary to address a variety of issues, including:

-The gap between water supply and water demand. The Statewide Water Supply Initiative forecasts that this gap could exceed 500,000 acre feet by 2050. Moreover, the largest regional gap is set to occur in the South Platte Basin, the most populous as well as the largest agriculture-producing basin.
-Colorado's drought conditions threaten to hasten the impact of the water supply gap. Indeed, the past two decades have been Colorado's warmest on record, dating back to the 1890s.
-Colorado's water quantity and quality questions can no longer be thought of separately. Each impacts the other and state water policy should address them conjunctively.
