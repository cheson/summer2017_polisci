Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on Recent Unemployment Numbers
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: Jan. 27, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement after the announcement that Colorado's unemployment rate dropped to 4.0 percent in December 2014. The national unemployment rate declined to 5.6 percent.
"We are moving in the right direction and more people are participating in the labor force, but despite this statewide resurgence, we know that many out-of-work Coloradans are still looking for work. By investing in our workforce development programs, and assisting the long-term unemployed workers, we will advance our challenge to make sure economic prosperity reaches every household in the state."
The last time the Colorado unemployment rate was as low as 4.0 percent was October 2007.
