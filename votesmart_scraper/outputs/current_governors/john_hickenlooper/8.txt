Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on the President's Budget Proposal
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: May 23, 2017
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement:
"President Trump's budget proposal is devastating. We have worked hard to create an environment that supports what is now the top economy in the country and makes Colorado a great place to live. The impact of cuts to Medicaid, Social Security and other programs - for the purpose of funding massive tax breaks for the wealthy - is out of step with Colorado's values. It threatens our hard-earned progress, pushes costs back to the state, and transfers additional burden to those who can least afford it. It really is Robin Hood in reverse - stealing from the poor (and the middle class) to give to the rich."
