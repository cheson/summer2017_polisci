Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: June 26, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement on the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges granting same-sex couples across the country the right to marry:
"The Supreme Court of the United States has definitively ruled that in this country, government will not limit who we might love, or restrict the rights and commitments that are a result of that love. Each violent expression of hate we experience should strengthen our resolve that we need to encourage more love, not less. We join the rest of the country in celebrating the news that equal dignity and equal rights prevailed."
