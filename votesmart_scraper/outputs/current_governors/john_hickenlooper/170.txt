Date: Dec. 3, 2014
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today apologized to the descendants of the Sand Creek Massacre at the 150th Anniversary and Commemoration Ceremony. He is the first governor in Colorado history to offer an apology for the massacre.
Below is the text of the speech as prepared:
"We should not be afraid to criticize and condemn that which is inexcusable, so I am here to offer something that has been a long time coming. On behalf of the State of Colorado, I want to apologize to the runners, to the tribal leaders and to all the indigenous people - and the proud and painful legacy - you represent. On behalf of the good, peaceful, loving people of Colorado, I want to say we are sorry for the atrocity that our government and its agents visited upon your ancestors. Today, as these runners complete their 16th Annual Sand Creek Spiritual Run, I want to assure you that we will not run from this history, and that we will always work for peace and healing."
