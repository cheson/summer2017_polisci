Gov. John Hickenlooper issued the following statement after the Secretary of the Interior approved the mining plan today for an expansion of the Colowyo Coal Mine in Craig, Colorado.
"We are grateful for the hard and rapid work of the Department of Interior and its Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement in meeting the court's timeline for the environmental assessment on the mining plan for an expansion of the Colowyo Coal Mine," said Hickenlooper. "This effort was of enormous importance to northwestern Colorado, particularly Moffat and Rio Blanco counties, and protects jobs and families, as well as an important source of tax revenues, in the region. Secretary Jewell and her agency are to be commended for listening to the community, understanding the stakes and responding aggressively to the situation."
