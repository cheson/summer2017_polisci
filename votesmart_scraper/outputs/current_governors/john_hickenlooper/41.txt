Press Release

Location: Denver, CO

The first phase of a comprehensive statewide trail map that is a key component of Gov. John Hickenlooper's Colorado the Beautiful initiative is now available online as work continues to complete the project.
In recognition of National Great Outdoors Month, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) is putting a preview of the project -- called the Colorado Trail System (CTS) -- online to demonstrate the power of providing easy access to public recreational information to more readily connect people with the outdoors.
"This comprehensive mapping project is an important way to support Colorado's rapidly growing demand for outdoor recreation opportunities," Hickenlooper said. "Assembling trail information that traditionally exists in dozens or hundreds of other places in one site will make it far easier for Coloradans to discover trail options often just a short distance from their homes."
CTS is making tracks to connect people, trails, and technology while promoting and enhancing Colorado's world-class system of recreational trails through targeted, curated content in a geographic context for a wide variety of outdoor enthusiasts. A dynamic and accessible tool, CTS will make public trail data from across management jurisdictions available to anyone looking to get out and enjoy Colorado's amazing and beautiful trails.
CTS is a statewide effort, in collaboration with local, state and federal trail managers and support staff. The map will grow, enhance, connect, and market statewide outdoor recreation resources. CPW has invested in the development of an online platform to display recreational data, but the power of the map will be driven by the data inside it.
