Statement

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement on escalation of violence in the Middle East and the U. S. Senate bipartisan resolution to work toward a durable ceasefire:

"Violence in the Middle East has escalated, as Israel has launched rocket strikes against the terrorist organization Hamas in Gaza. As outlined in a bipartisan resolution that was adopted in the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent on Tuesday evening, I support the United States' mediation efforts for a durable ceasefire agreement that immediately ends Hamas rocket assaults and leads to the demilitarization of Gaza. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the violence on both sides. In chaos and carnage, right and wrong bleed in the rubble, and it becomes more critical that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel, the only enduring democracy in the region. We wish the Middle East the peace it has for so long been unable to find."
