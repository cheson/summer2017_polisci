Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement regarding the completion of work by the oil and gas task force. The group was charged in July 2014 to craft recommendations to minimize land use conflicts that can occur when siting oil and gas facilities near homes, schools, businesses and recreational areas.
"We commend the task force for literally thousands of hours of volunteer work. Their determination and willingness to really hear each other was remarkable, and their recommendations are significant in both breadth and the level of consensus they achieved. They made undeniable progress for all of Colorado today and we are extremely grateful for their work."

"We have not rested in addressing the tough issues that come with balancing quality of life with an important and thriving industry. From advances in groundwater protections and methane limits to today's recommendations that ensure protection of people, industry and the environment, working together is how we always find the right solutions for Colorado."
