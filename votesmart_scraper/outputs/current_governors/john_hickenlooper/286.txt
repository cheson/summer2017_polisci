BREAK IN TRANSCRIPT
CROWLEY: Joining me now from outside Arapahoe High School is Colorado governor John Hickenlooper. Governor, thank you for joining us. You had this situation Friday in a school where young gunman entered a high school, shot and critically wounded a young female student and went on to shoot himself. And all in a very short period of time. Can you first start with anything you know about the condition of the high schooler?
GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, COLORADO: Well, Claire Davis was a wonderful, wonderful young woman. I went to the hospital, I visited her parents. They're obviously very distraught. She's in critical condition. You know, it's unspeakable.
CROWLEY: It is, governor. And too often you and I have spoken about things like this. Watching this unfold and the information that we've gotten, there are a couple questions that arise. First is, this is a young man who walked into a high school, got into a high school with a machete, a pump shotgun, the ammo strapped to a band across him as well as some Molotov cocktails. He was visibly armed we are told. So correct me if I'm wrong. How does that happen? It seems to me that at the entrances of schools, someone that is visibly armed should not be able to get in.
HICKENLOOPER: Well, this is a large high school. Like many of the large high schools, there are kids coming in and out all the time. They did have a deputy sheriff on the premise. I mean, the moment there was trouble, he was running to the scene. But you know there's a balance. And school administrators and school boards are trying to make a school not be a fortress. They want to be a place for education. I'm sure that's one of the decisions that we're going to be looking at again going down the road with another shooting like this.
