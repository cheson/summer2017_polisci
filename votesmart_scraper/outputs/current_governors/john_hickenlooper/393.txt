Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed several bills, including an early literacy bill that recognizes the importance of early childhood literacy as a critical foundational skill in later academic development and success.

"This is legislation that really does put kids first," Hickenlooper said about HB12-1238, also known as The READ Act. "Reading proficiency is the single most powerful foundation that we have for all future success."

The literacy bill focuses on the early identification of children with significant reading deficiencies and requires the creation of a customized scientifically-based intervention plan called a "READ plan." Additionally, parents and educators have greater opportunities to work together on both the student's academic progress and decisions about advancement.

"The READ Act is a significant step in the early literacy movement and an excellent example of what a broad coalition of caring people can accomplish when they come together to focus on the future of Colorado's children and the economic vitality and prosperity of this state," said Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia.
