Lt. Governor Donna Lynne announced 12 organizations in Colorado will receive $5,061,409 in AmeriCorps grants from the Corporation for National and Community Service. Lynne announced the award during the AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps Graduation on Tuesday.
"As a state who has greatly benefited from AmeriCorps for more than 20 years, we know it is critical that we are able to rely on AmeriCorps as a partner in solving Colorado's most pressing needs," said Lynne. "We are excited to use these funds to build on the impressive legacy of National Service in Colorado."
"For more than 20 years, AmeriCorps members have had a positive and lasting impact on the toughest challenges facing our nation," said Wendy Spencer, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service. "Building on Colorado's strong tradition of neighbor helping neighbor, AmeriCorps members will improve lives and strengthen communities across Colorado. While they serve others, AmeriCorps members will also expand opportunity for themselves - gaining skills and experience to jumpstart their careers. I salute every AmeriCorps member for his or her dedication and determination to "get things done' and respond to the needs in their communities."
The grants will support more than 1100 AmeriCorps members across the state who will engage in numerous activities including: energy and water conservation, increasing literacy rates in children and providing wrap around services to people experiencing homelessness.
