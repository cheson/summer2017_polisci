The Pedal the Plains sponsor dinner drew a generous crowd Thursday evening at Keith Bath Farms east of Fort Morgan with hay rides, dinner and plenty of beer.
But the spread didn't distract people from the main message: Pedal the Plains is a great way to build appreciation and awareness of Colorado's agriculture and rural areas.
"This event is another dream come true for me," said Keith Bath during his speech before turning the microphone over to Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper.
In Pedal the Plains' three years of existence, this is the second time Bath opened his farm to host the sponsor dinner. Past Denver Post Publisher Dean Singleton thanked Bath for his generosity.
Hickenlooper spoke about his idea for Pedal the Plains, an idea to connect the world of small-town, agriculture-centered Colorado with the urban parts of the state. He also tipped his hat to agriculture.
"We are fourth in the country for job creation, we are No. 1 for fastest-growing economy for a state in America," Hickenlooper said. "It would have never happened without agriculture."
That's why there is so much celebration of agriculture over the course of Pedal the Plains.
"A big part of Pedal the Plains is to make sure that we recognize that and do everything we can to make sure people in the urban areas to know, not just where their food comes from, but they know how much they owe to the entire eastern Plains," he said.

Hickenlooper thanked all the sponsors for the event before letting the dinner commence.
