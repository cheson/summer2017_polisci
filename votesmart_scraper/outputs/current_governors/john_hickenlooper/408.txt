Gov. John Hickenlooper today joined Trace Devanny, chairman and CEO of The TriZetto Group Inc., and Mike Fitzgerald, president and CEO of the Southeast Business Partnership, to announce that TriZetto will build a new worldwide headquarters in the Meridian International Business Center in Douglas County. The headquarters will immediately generate up to 500 construction jobs and later accommodate up to 750 new jobs at TriZetto over the next five years.

"As companies like TriZetto grow and expand in Colorado, we further solidify Colorado as the best state to do business," Hickenlooper said. "TriZetto recognized Colorado's highly-educated workforce, strong healthcare and technology industry sector, expansive pool of local talent from area colleges and accessible location for visiting clients. We are committed to helping businesses grow and thrive here, and we look forward to seeing more businesses expand in Colorado."

TriZetto provides information technology solutions that help healthcare payers and providers achieve compliance, enhance efficiency and collaborate to deliver better health. TriZetto solutions touch more than half the U.S. insured population and reach more than 21,000 physician practices. With some 3,300 associates and offices across the globe, TriZetto has been headquartered in Denver since July 2010. In addition to creating hundreds of new jobs in Colorado, TriZetto's worldwide headquarters will bring up to $250 million of capital investment in the state over the next five years, as well as $70 million in worker pay annually, money that will be reinvested largely in Colorado's economy.

"I strongly believe our new worldwide headquarters is a win-win for both Colorado and for TriZetto," said Devanny. "For TriZetto, it means continued success fueled in part by Colorado's welcoming business community and impressive workforce. For Colorado, it means more jobs -- professional, high-quality, high-tech jobs in the growing healthcare IT sector. Colorado will be home to one of the nation's largest healthcare IT companies. TriZetto plays a vital role in improving the cost and quality of healthcare, a $2.8 trillion industry that presents this country's greatest challenge."

The build-to-suit, 165,000-square-foot headquarters in the Meridian International Business Center will be built by the Opus Group and owned and managed by Lexington Realty Trust. TriZetto will lease the building as its sole tenant. Construction will be completed early next year, and employees will move into the new facility in spring 2013.

"TriZetto's commitment to expanding in Colorado demonstrates that our efforts to attract, retain and grow jobs here are working," said Ken Lund, executive director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International
