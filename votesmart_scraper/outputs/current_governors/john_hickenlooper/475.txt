Hickenlooper Thanks More Than 14,300 Individual Contributors, Sets Fundraising Mark
Press Release

John Hickenlooper thanked the tremendous number of people who have supported his run for governor today as his campaign released a high-water mark for fundraising in a single month.
More than 14,300 people have contributed to Hickenlooper's campaign since he entered the race as an underdog in January, according to reports filed with the Secretary of State's office. Contributors represent a cross-section of Colorado with wide-ranging, bi-partisan support.
"Nine month ago we stood in front of the Capitol and said we would run a different kind of campaign if people would support us," Hickenlooper said. "But even we could not have anticipated the momentum generated by our pledge to run a positive campaign focused on creating jobs and bringing a business sense to government."
With a month to go in the election, Hickenlooper has garnered support from more individual contributors than any candidate in the 2006 gubernatorial cycle or this year.
In September, those supporters gave just over $700,000 to bolster Hickenlooper's campaign. Though the month spans three reporting periods, it represents the most successful fundraising month so far for the campaign.
"I was told it would be impossible to run a positive campaign for governor when I started," Hickenlooper said, "but the challenges we face in Colorado are too important for petty political attacks. I said I would focus on finding solutions and turning our economy around, and it is clear now that people have responded. I can't say 'thank you' enough."
