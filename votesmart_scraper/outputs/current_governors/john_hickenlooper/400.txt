The U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced today new hydraulic fracturing regulations for oil and gas development on BLM-administered public lands. The rules include chemical disclosure regulations similar to those developed and implemented in Colorado.

"We are pleased that the Bureau of Land Management modeled its disclosure requirements for fracturing fluids after the Colorado rule, which is the most protective and transparent in the country as it requires the disclosure of the chemicals as well as their purpose and concentrations," Hickenlooper said.

The federal rules affect activity on BLM lands, but the Colorado regulations still apply. Like the Colorado rule that took effect April 1, 2012:
· The BLM rule will require disclosure of fracturing fluids, including each chemical and additive trade name and purpose, as well as the concentration of each ingredient.
· Limited trade secret protection is provided.
· The BLM rule requires mechanical integrity testing and cement bond logs to ensure well integrity, as well as reporting on volume of fracturing fluids, proppants, chemicals and water, pressures, volume of recovered flowback fluid and methods used for managing and disposing of the flowback fluids.
