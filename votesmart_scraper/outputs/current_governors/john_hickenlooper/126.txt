Gov. Hickenlooper Vetoes "Red Light" and "Photo Radar" Bills
Press Release
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: June 3, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today vetoed SB 15-276 "Concerning the Elimination of the Use of Automated Vehicle Identification Systems for Traffic Law Enforcement" and HB 15-1098 "Concerning the Elimination of the Use of Automated Surveillance Camera Vehicle Identification Systems for Traffic Enforcement."
"Speeding and disregard for traffic signals are a danger for all drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians. These actions have very real, at times fatal, consequences," said Hickenlooper. "While not always popular, when used correctly, radar and red light cameras make roads safer. Unfortunately, these bills go too far."
"To that end, we encourage the General Assembly to enact legislation in 2016 that limits photo radar and red light cameras to only the following locations: (1) school zones; (2) construction and roadway work zones; and (3) areas with disproportionately high traffic and pedestrian accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Secondly, legislation should require that fine revenue be used solely for traffic safety improvements and enforcement, rather than general operating funds or non-transportation purposes."
The governor also directed the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to study the use of automated traffic enforcement systems.
"Together, we can create legislation that continues to allow cities and towns to decide what is best for themselves, while also protecting the safety of drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians."
