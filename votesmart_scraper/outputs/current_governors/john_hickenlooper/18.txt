Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on President Trump's Executive Order Pulling Back on Climate Policies
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: March 28, 2017
Location: Denver, CO

Today's Executive Order by the President pulling back on policies addressing climate change will not deter Colorado's efforts. Natural gas has become more economical than coal, and Colorado is a national leader on wind and solar energy, which are a boon to our economy, jobs and the environment.
Our efforts to clean our air and protect the natural environment are part of what draws young people, families, and businesses to Colorado. Our outdoor recreation industry, which helps create jobs all across the state, is dependent upon cleaner air and water. We have a history of solving complex problems and taking action to move the state closer to meeting its clean air goals, and we have shown that we can have cleaner air and reduce harmful carbon emissions at essentially no additional costâ€’ potentially even saving money for Colorado families.
We will keep building a clean energy future that creates Colorado jobs, improves our health and addresses the harmful consequences of a changing climate.
