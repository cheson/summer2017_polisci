Gov. Hickenlooper Announces Transfer of State-owned Land to Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: Nov. 29, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced the transfer of 640 acres of state-owned land to the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site. The transfer comes a year after Hickenlooper became the first Colorado governor to offer an apology for the Sand Creek Massacre. It is the result of years of collaboration between the History Colorado State Historical Fund, the History Colorado Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, the Civil War Trust, and the National Park Service.
"Sand Creek is one of the most historically significant sites in Colorado and the United States," Hickenlooper said. "Our hope in offering last year's apology was to fully acknowledge the dark chapter of our history. Today's land transfer is an important step on the path toward a new era of healing and a critical part of preserving the Sand Creek Massacre story."
