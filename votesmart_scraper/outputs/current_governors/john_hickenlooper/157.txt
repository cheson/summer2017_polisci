Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement in response to President Obama's State of the Union address:

"In this State of the Union Address, the president made clear that he has put his focus on fortifying and expanding the middle class, while doing whatever we can to help cultivate high-paying jobs so that more Americans can earn their way into the middle class. That strategy has been at the cornerstone of our economic blueprint for Colorado throughout the last four years, and as I mentioned in our State of the State just a few days ago, in Colorado, we will remain relentlessly committed to workforce development, education and job training."
