Gov. John Hickenlooper today congratulated the City of Trinidad on becoming the most recent community to join Colorado's Main Street速 Program. Trinidad joins 12 other Colorado communities that have received the designation from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

"Trinidad's unique heritage and emerging creative district are among the many assets this community has to offer its residents, visitors and the state," Hickenlooper said. "The Main Street program is an excellent way for Trinidad to engage its community members in shaping the future of its downtown development."

The Main Street速 Program helps to revitalize downtown districts leveraging historic preservation. The program advocates for community self-reliance, local empowerment and the rebuilding of central business districts based on their traditional assets of unique architecture, personal service, local ownership and a sense of community. The Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA) is the statewide coordinating agency for all Main Street速 communities and is sponsored, in part, by a generous grant from the State Historical Fund.

"We're so pleased to work with Trinidad and the other Main Street communities on realizing their goals and visions for their downtowns," said DOLA Executive Director Reeves Brown. "Main streets represent a community's history and provide a central hub for businesses, services and tourism. This fits right in with DOLA's mission to strengthen Colorado communities."

Communities are accepted into the program on a competitive basis. The program provides resources, training and technical services in four key areas: economic restructuring, design, organization and promotion.

"We are thrilled that the 2012 Trinidad Community Assessment recommended that Trinidad consider implementing the Colorado Main Street Program as a tool for revitalizing and preserving Trinidad's historic downtown commercial district," said Trinidad Mayor Bernadette Baca-Gonzalez. "The Colorado Main Street Program will help our efforts to revitalize our historic downtown areas, boost economic development and build a strong community."

- Brush (since 2001)
