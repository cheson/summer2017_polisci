Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today joined the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to reopen State Highway (SH) 7 between Raymond and Lyons. The highway is the last of 27 highways damaged or destroyed by the September floods to reopen.
"This is an extraordinary day for Colorado as we celebrate the completion of all temporary repairs on our state highway system ahead of schedule," Hickenlooper said. "CDOT, its contractors and local partners should all be proud of this tremendous accomplishment that repaired roads and reconnected communities."
To complete the temporary repairs along SH 7, 60 pieces of equipment were utilized to help crews move approximately 171,000 cubic yards of reclaimed onsite materials, which would fill 17,000 single dump trucks; to replace or repair 27 culverts totaling nearly 1,300 linear feet, which is equal in length to nearly 4.3 football fields; to place approximately 27,000 tons of aggregate road base and 14,600 tons of asphalt; and to install 9,312 linear feet of concrete barrier for the safety of the traveling public.
While SH 7 is now open to all traffic, it is important for motorists to remember that the repairs are temporary and the speed limit has been reduced in areas. The permanent repairs will begin in spring 2014.
