Gov. John Hickenlooper announced today the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles has a new computerized check-in system designed to cut wait times for Coloradans at driver license offices.

The DMV's "Wait Less" project is another step in using technology to enhance customer service for the nearly 1 million Colorado residents who apply or renew a Colorado Driver License or state-issued identification card each year.

"This service is designed to save time by letting people schedule their appointments before coming to the DMV," Hickenlooper said. "That is a huge improvement from the old way of doing business, where people never know how long it will take until they get to a DMV office."

Wait Less lets residents schedule appointments on the Internet. Once they arrive at the DMV office, there will be a check-in kiosk station that reduces lines and allows multiple customers to check-in.

Barbara Brohl, Executive Director of the Department of Revenue, which includes the DMV, said the kiosks will be a model for providing additional services to customers.

"We should soon be able to help our customers change addresses, register to vote and renew online at the kiosks," Brohl said. "We also hope to add customer text message notifications, so people can avoid waiting on site. With a text message, they can be called back just in time to be at the front of the line."

The DMV has introduced Wait Less at its Lakewood office at 1881 Pierce St. The DMV plans to roll out the system to the Denver Central Driver's License office this spring. By the end of 2012, DMV plans to roll out the service to 11 other offices in Aurora, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Denver North East, Fort Collins, Golden, Greeley, Littleton, Longmont, Northglenn and Parker.
