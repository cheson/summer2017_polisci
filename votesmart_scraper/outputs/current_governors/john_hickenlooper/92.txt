Press Release

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed an Executive Order that establishes new greening government goals reflecting the state's commitment to efficient and sustainable government operations.
The Order sets one and five year goals for the state focused on energy and water efficiency, petroleum reduction, greenhouse gas emissions reductions and environmentally preferable purchasing.
This announcement builds upon a series of Executive Orders issued by the state since 2003. In 2012, the Colorado Greening Government Report Card highlighted numerous achievements in state government, including a 21 percent reduction in energy use per square foot in state facilities, annual savings of 40 million kWh and 150 million gallons of water as a result of energy performance contracting, design and construction of 54 LEED-certified buildings, and a 5.3 percent reduction in petroleum use.
"State government can, and should, lead by example to promote healthy communities and a healthy environment," said Hickenlooper. "Collectively, these actions continue to save taxpayer money and reduce impacts on Colorado's environment and public health."
The Order also establishes the Greening Government Leadership Council, which will support efforts to meet the goals and directives, and ensure that Colorado remains nationally recognized in advancing outstanding government business practices that promote a healthy environment and foster economic and social vitality. The Council will also provide a report card on progress toward goals and respective agency and department accomplishments.
