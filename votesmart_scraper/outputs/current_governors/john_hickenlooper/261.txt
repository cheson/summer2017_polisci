Press Release
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: Feb. 23, 2014
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper released this statement today in response to the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission's approval of comprehensive changes to rules governing oil and gas activities in the state, including the nation's first-ever regulations designed to detect and reduce methane emissions:

"Colorado is proving once again that collaboration and compromise help solve important issues facing our state. The new rules approved by Colorado's Air Quality Control Commission, after taking input from varied and often conflicting interests, will ensure Colorado has the cleanest and safest oil and gas industry in the country and help preserve jobs.

"We want to thank the environmental community, the energy industry and our state agencies for working together so hard to take this significant step forward. All Coloradans deserve a healthy economy and a healthy environment, and we're working to ensure that Colorado continues to have both."

The governor will be joined by representatives from the environmental community and the energy industry at a press conference Tuesday at the state Capitol to discuss the new rules.
