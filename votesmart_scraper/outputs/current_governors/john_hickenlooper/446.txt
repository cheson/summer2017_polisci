Gov. John Hickenlooper today ordered flags be lowered to half-staff on all public buildings statewide on Sunday, Sept.11, to honor the memory of those who died on Sept. 11, 2001. Flags should be lowered from sunrise to sunset.
"This anniversary is a solemn time for all of us to remember and honor those who died 10 years ago," Hickenlooper said. "It's also a time we can reflect on our strength and resilience as a nation and give thanks to those who continue to protect our country from future attacks."
Hickenlooper also called for a Moment of Remembrance statewide at 11 a.m. Sunday. For one minute, first responders, houses of worship, towns and others throughout the state should sound sirens and bells in a signal to everyone to stop and remember the 10th anniversary of the events of Sept.11, 2001. The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution (S. Res. 237) this summer calling on all Americans to participate in this Moment of Remembrance.
