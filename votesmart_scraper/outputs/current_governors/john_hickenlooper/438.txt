Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced that all military men and women can receive free admission at each of Colorado's 42 state parks on Veterans Day, Nov. 11.
"Our servicemen and women give us peace of mind and keep our country safe every day of the year," Hickenlooper said. "We can never truly repay the debt to our active and retired military personnel, but we can formally thank them on Veterans Day for the sacrifices they have made. We hope they are able to spend the day at a state park with family and friends."
The Colorado State Parks Board recently approved free admission for military men and women at all 42 state parks on Veterans Day, Nov. 11, to recognize their service to the nation.
To obtain free admission to a state park, veterans, active duty personnel and their families must show:
* A valid active, reserve or retired military identification card
* An identification card from the Veterans' Administration, Veterans of Foreign Wars or the American Legion
* Discharge papers or a DD214
* Or other proof of service
The identification should be presented at the park gate. All other passengers in the vehicle will be admitted for free. This offer applies only to free entrance; other fees, rules and regulations will apply. For more information, visit http://dnr.state.co.us.
