Blog: Check Out Our Second Ad, "Hot Seat"
Statement

If you've been anywhere near a TV, you know our opponents have been attacking our style of leadership: bringing people together, looking at the data, and listening carefully to find common ground.
But that's what you have to do in the hot seat as Governor. No single political party has all the right ideas, but if people are willing to hear each other out, we can accomplish so much by working together -- like cutting 1,200 unnecessary regulations so small businesses can grow and put people to work.
Our next TV ad makes exactly that point.
In the restaurant business, I learned that if you really listen, you can meet in the middle. By working together, Colorado has moved from 40th to 4th in job creation and we have the fastest growing economy in the nation. That doesn't happen by accident. And it certainly won't continue without committed supporters like you.
All the best,
John
