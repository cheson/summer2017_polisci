Governor John Hickenlooper announced the state's new grantees of the Advanced Industry Accelerator Grants today at a press conference at RavenBrick. Twelve total grants --six Proof of Concept and six Early Stage Capital and Retention -- will be awarded to Colorado organizations for a total of $1,583,244.

"In just its second year, the Advanced Industry Accelerator Grant program is helping to grow and accelerate Colorado's innovative business ecosystem and help ensure that our state's innovators compete in the global economy," Gov. John Hickenlooper said. "We are thrilled to have awarded 67 grants for a total of $8.2 million, and are excited to see the successes these forward-thinking organizations have next."

Proof-of-Concept grants are open to Colorado research universities, federal labs located in Colorado and other private, nonprofit and for-profit labs with valid technology transfer offices. These grants are for pre-commercialization research and commercialization preparation.

Proof-of-Concept Grantees:
· Colorado School of Mines -- $30,000: Development of an energy absorbing device for sportswear to reduce trauma
· University of Colorado, Boulder -- $50,000: Ultrasonic system for activity and fall monitoring
· University of Colorado, Boulder -- $134,847: TTwistor advanced small unmanned aircraft system
· University of Colorado, Boulder -- $45,397: Scalable nano-imprinting of commercial ultra-filtration membranes
· University of Colorado, Boulder -- $103,000: 4DCT-Ventilation, a new lung function imaging modality for radiation therapy
· University of Colorado, Boulder -- $50,000: Laser activated device for canine glaucoma
Early Stage Capital and Retention Grant funding is used to fund companies using technologies developed in proof of concept grants and other early stage start-ups that have created viable products that meet a market need and that can be created or manufactured in Colorado and exported globally. These grants should enhance the commercialization of advanced industry products or services in Colorado.

Early Stage Capital and Retention Grantees:
· aWhere, Inc., Denver -- $45,000: aWhere is transforming the way agriculture initiatives are managed and monitored through a globally accessible location intelligence platform and bio-climatic content.
· DH2i, Fort Collins -- $125,000: DH2i is becoming one of the world's premier providers of server application virtualization software.
· MBio Diagnostics Inc., Boulder -- $250,000: MBio Diagnostics develops and commercializes revolutionary, inexpensive tests for human disease diagnosis, as well as food, veterinary and environmental testing.
· Prima-Temp, Inc., Boulder -- $250,000: Prima-Temp, Inc. is a medical device company developing innovative temperature monitoring for early recognition of acute illness and natural pregnancy.
· Ravenbrick LLC, Denver -- $250,000: RavenBrick manufactures RavenWindow, smart windows that automatically reduce unwanted heat and glare when temperatures are high, and allow light and warmth in when temperatures drop. This not only improves building and home comfort and reduces glare, but also dramatically reduces the demand on air conditioning and heating systems, saving both money and natural resources.
· Reference Technologies, Inc., Lafayette -- $250,000: Reference Technologies designs an innovative solution to address the current limited flight duration of battery powered micro-Unmanned Aerial Systems air frames while increasing payload capacity and the ability to deploy mission specific payloads. Their Hummingbird Series UAS's have a flight duration from two to more than 7 hours, and payload capacities ranging from 10 to 50 pounds.
In the upcoming fiscal year, there will be three Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant Program cycles with the following deadlines: November 1, 2014; March 1, 2015; and July 1, 2015. Bioscience Discovery and Evaluation Grants will be due on November 1, 2014.

The Advanced Industry Accelerator Programs were created in 2013 to promote growth and sustainability in Colorado's seven identified advanced industries by driving innovation, accelerating commercialization, encouraging public-private partnerships, increasing access to early stage capital and creating a strong infrastructure that increases the state's capacity to be globally competitive. The programs encompass three distinct grant programs: Proof of Concept, Early Stage Company and Commercialization Infrastructure.
