Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on the House of Representatives Vote on the American Health Care Act
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: May 4, 2017
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement:
"This new bill threatens to end health insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of hard working Coloradans, by cutting important tax credits and critical federal funding. The new changes do not adequately protect people with pre-existing conditions. Further, it is irresponsible to vote on this bill without an updated estimate of how much it will cost and how many Americans will lose coverage. The Senate should reject this bill."
