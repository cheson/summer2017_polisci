I am proud that the Pikes Peak region is home to the brave men and women stationed at Fort Carson. Their sacrifices keep our country FREE. I want you to know that this community is committed to supporting them and their families in keeping Fort Carson the best assignment in the US Army. I hope that the Army recognizes the value of Fort Carson and the surrounding communities and keeps a strong presence here.
Thank you for your service to our country!
