Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement after the Colorado Supreme Court ruled to uphold state laws on hydraulic fracturing:
"We appreciate the Supreme Court's guidance on balancing private property rights and local government jurisdiction of oil and gas operations in Colorado. Striking the right balance is not only important to public health and safety, it has enormous implications for our state's economy.
Colorado has come a long way on these issues over the last decade. The work of the Task Force amplified the role of local governments in siting large oil and gas facilities and built a stronger connection between state and local regulators. Communities are working more productively with operators, crafting solutions that take into account local concerns while respecting property rights. These steps come on top of several major rulemakings since 2011 that reduce the impacts of oil and gas development on surrounding areas.
We believe collaboration is better than litigation and careful regulation is better than legislation to strike balance. We'll continue to work creatively and energetically with communities and industry to ensure our world-class environment is protected while remaining a place that is welcoming to business and jobs."
