Gov. John Hickenlooper today authorized the distribution of $20.6 million in state aviation fuel tax revenues through 44 grants to Colorado general aviation airports under the Aviation Discretionary Grant program. The program is administered by the Colorado Department of Transportation's Division of Aeronautics.

"We have improved public-use airports all across the state by leveraging these grants with local and federal matching funds," Hickenlooper said. "These airports are critical to the economic well-being of communities as energy, tourism and business travel to local destinations continues to grow. Developing and maintaining an efficient, safe transportation system is vital to Colorado's economic growth."

The grants ranged in size from $3,650 to $3 million and require local or federal participation. The projects receiving funding include safety and infrastructure projects needed at airports ranging from Denver International Airport, one of the world's busiest, to community airports in places such as Springfield and Paonia.

"It has been gratifying to see this program grow over the years," said Joe, Thibodeaux, chairman of the Colorado Aeronautical Board. "Our public-use airports have consistently come to us with outstanding projects that serve important public transportation needs, and we are pleased to be able to help make these projects a reality. This is a true example of state/local and often federal partnerships that together help us accomplish much more than any of us would be able to do by ourselves."

The Aviation Discretionary Grant Program was instituted by an amendment to the Colorado Constitution in 1992. Proposals from public-use airports are received and evaluated by CDOT Aeronautics staff and approved by the Aeronautical Board, which is comprised of aviation industry representatives appointed by the governor and approved by the Colorado Senate.
