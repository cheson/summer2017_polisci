Press Release

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today delivered the FY 2012-13 proposed budget to the Joint Budget Committee.
"As you will see, the budget reflects the ongoing work of closing the State's structural budget gap and funding the demands of numerous federal and State Constitutional requirements," Hickenlooper wrote in a letter to the JBC. "The proposal also contains several proposals to protect the most vulnerable Coloradans, promote economic growth, continue needed reforms in education and modernize State government."
The FY 2012-13 proposed budget is $20.09 billion, of which $7.39 billion is from the General Fund. These amounts represent growth rates over the last fiscal year of 1.7% ($342.6 million) in total funds and 3.2% ($227.1 million) in the General Fund.
"The General Fund budget (financed by income and sales taxes) is the area of the budget that is most reflective of the overall economic condition of the state," the governor's letter said. "Though there has been a partial recovery from the recent recession, the revenue picture remains unsettled and we expect only modest General Fund revenue growth in FY 2012-13."
Demands for State services and benefits over the past five years have increased substantially and reflect the pressures of a growing population and a weak economy. Specifically:
* Medicaid enrollment has increased by 281,000 (72%),
* Children's Health Plan+ caseload has increased by 11,000 (19%),
* K-12 student enrollment has increased by 52,000 (6.8%),
* Higher Education enrollment has increased 33,600 (20.5%), and
* Annual State Park visits have increased by 766,000 (6.5%).
