Gov. John Hickenlooper and Chief Justice Nancy Rice today officiated the swearing-in of Donna Lynne as Colorado's 49th lieutenant governor. Lynne was nominated by Hickenlooper in March and confirmed by the General Assembly last week. She will serve in a dual role at lieutenant governor and chief operating officer.
"Donna's executive prowess and experience in both public and private business operations will help us make even more of an impact on programs across the state in this new role," said Hickenlooper. "She has spent her career as a champion for families and communities and is renowned for her ability to listen, collaborate and then get it done. We are grateful for her willingness to serve."
As the chief operating officer, Lynne will work to create operations strategy and policies that will strengthen the efficiency of state government.
"It is truly a privilege to serve Coloradans in this role," Lynne said. "I look forward to working with the governor, the leadership team and state employees to ensure we deliver quality services to our residents with efficiency and effectiveness."
Before becoming lieutenant governor, Lynne was the executive vice president of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, overseeing more than an $8 billion budget, 1.3 million members and 16,000 employees for Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.
Lynne holds a Bachelor of Arts (Economics and Political Science), a Masters of Public Administration, and Doctor of Public Health from Columbia University. She is married to Jim Brown and together they have five children. She enjoys the Colorado outdoors and has climbed all of Colorado's fourteeners.
