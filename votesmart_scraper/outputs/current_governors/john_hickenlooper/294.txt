Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced that Colorado Parks and Wildlife will offer all military men and women free admission to Colorado's state parks on Veterans Day, Monday, Nov. 11.

"We are grateful for our service members whose countless sacrifices protect our freedoms and provide our country with safety and a peace of mind," Hickenlooper said. "We can never fully thank these men and women who put their country first, often before themselves and their families. On Veterans Day we will honor them and hope they enjoy Colorado's amazing outdoors."

All 42 state parks will offer free visits, with the exception of St. Vrain State Park, which is closed until spring due to flood damage. Visitors to Eldorado Canyon State Park will have limited access as the park is only partially open following the recent flooding
