These meetings will help establish a mutually beneficial partnership between the 13 states on the agreement and the auto companies."

The governors will also tour the auto manufacturing plants and drive natural gas vehicles during the visit of the manufacturers.

The Memorandum of Understanding is a bi-partisan, coordinated effort to develop a functional and affordable original equipment manufacturer fleet natural gas vehicle that will also meet public demand.
