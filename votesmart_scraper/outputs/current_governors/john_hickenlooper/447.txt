Press Release
By: John Hickenlooper

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed an executive order to continue the No Kid Hungry Colorado campaign (formerly the Colorado Campaign to End Childhood Hunger by 2015) at a Hunger Free Colorado event.
The campaign, initiated by former Gov. Bill Ritter and Lt. Gov. Barbara O'Brien in 2009, works to increase the number of children receiving nutritious meals in school breakfast and summer lunch programs while developing a comprehensive plan to end childhood hunger in Colorado by 2015.
"Many families have been hit hard by the economic downturn," Hickenlooper said. "School breakfast programs help ensure children have access to nutritious foods so they can study hard in school, grow strong and lead active lives. The No Kid Hungry Colorado campaign is making certain those who falls on hard times know about these programs and that no child in Colorado goes hungry."
The campaign is a partnership between the Office of the Governor, Share Our Strength and Hunger Free Colorado. Together, these leaders are committed to ending childhood hunger in Colorado by removing the roadblocks to existing programs so that Colorado's children get the food they need.
