Gov. John Hickenlooper released this statement today after Anadarko Petroleum Corp. announced it plans to add more than 1,200 drilling locations in the Wattenberg field in northeastern Colorado:
"Anadarko's announcement today shows once again that Colorado is a leader in the energy sector of our country's economy. We are thrilled to see the company plan a significant investment in Colorado. This expected growth will create jobs and make more revenues available to local communities. We look forward to supporting Anadarko, its workforce of 1,000 people already here and the thousands of contractors it hires throughout the state.
"We also continue to work proactively to maintain the highest safety and environmental standards for oil and gas companies in Colorado, while also cutting permit times and making it easier and more predictable to develop natural gas and oil here. Anadarko's future expansion in Colorado, on top of our effort last week to launch a multi-state initiative aimed at developing natural gas-fueled vehicles, is further evidence that Colorado is at the center of energy development in this country."
