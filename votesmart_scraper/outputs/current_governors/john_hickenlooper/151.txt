Location: Denver, CO

Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia joined more than 45 million participants across the nation for the National Education Association's 18th annual Read Across America Day celebration today as part of the Colorado Reads: Early Literacy Initiative.

The festivities celebrated the legacy of Dr. Seuss with Garcia reading Oh the Places You'll Go and a special rhyming proclamation at the Capitol to second grade students from Clyde Miller Elementary School.

"Read Across America Day is a great way to raise awareness about the importance of literacy for policy makers but, more importantly, a way to emphasize that reading is fun both for children and adults" said Garcia. "Dr. Seuss has an extraordinary ability to bring parents and children together to strengthen family bonds while developing a lifelong love of books."

In addition to the celebration of Dr. Seuss, Garcia shared the outcomes of the One Book 4 Colorado program, the statewide initiative that offers free copies of the same book to every 4-year-old in Colorado in English and in Spanish. In 2014, 75,000 copies of the book selection, Grumpy Bird by Jeremy Tankard, were given away at more than 500 sites, including public libraries, Reach Out and Read Health Clinics, and Denver Preschool Program preschool classrooms.

McDonald's and Emily Griffith Technical College also provided breakfast at the event to kick-off the launch of National School Breakfast Week.
