Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement:
We can't imagine the emotional roller coaster this family has endured. The Colorado Department of Corrections did what was required by law and released Mr. Lima-Marin to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The family has shown amazing strength and we hope this is a temporary stop on his way to being reunited with his family.
