Gov. John Hickenlooper has made it a point to avoid negative campaigning, which can make it tricky to respond to attack ads, such as the video the Republican Governors Association released on Aug. 19. The GOP campaign group mocked the Democratic incumbent's pool-playing -- specifically, the stick he shot with President Obama during a visit in July.
The governor likes to talk about playing pool, too, it would appear. He released a video Thursday in which he respins the GOP narrative. Hickenlooper compares navigating the obstacles on the table to choosing the right angles to move the state past obstacles such as an economic recession and the state's landslide of natural disasters during his first term.
Hickenlooper provides warm narration to the video shot in soft amber tones.
"Coloradans know better than to take their cues from attack ads," he concludes.
The campaign summed it up for reporters this way: "The video recognizes the hard work and success that Coloradans have had in overcoming tough economic conditions and 13 federally declared disasters to create an economy that was just ranked #1 in the country by Business Insider."
