Hickenlooper for Colorado released the campaign's second television advertisement Wednesday, exposing John Hickenlooper's bent for frugality in a spot we simply call "Cheap."
The ad, with a tagline "Colorado can do more with less," wiHICKENLOOPER'S SECOND AD IS ALL ABOUT SAVING MONEYll be airing in a rotation with Hickenlooper's popular "Shower" ad beginning today.
The ad highlights how Hickenlooper successfully brought a business perspective to government by applying the lessons he learned running brewpubs and restaurants to the mayor's office.
"As a mayor, I'm always looking for ways to save money," Hickenlooper says in the ad. "We've turned the city around and saved millions with big stuff like fewer offices and city workers, but also small stuff like tap water instead of bottled; paper-free Fridays; sweaters in the winter; low AC in the summer..."
Colorado's next governor will face tough budgets, and Hickenlooper is the only candidate with a proven record of doing more with less in both the public and private sector. Balancing Colorado's budget will require significant, painful cuts, but every little bit helps.
Hickenlooper's attention to practical cost-cutting measures is part of how he was able to reduce the size of Denver government by 7 percent.
In "Cheap," Hickenlooper goes on and on about ways he has found to save a little money in every aspect of his life.
Hickenlooper for Colorado has reserved $1.2 million in television ad time, according to reports filed with the Secretary of State's office. The campaign began running ads August 19.
