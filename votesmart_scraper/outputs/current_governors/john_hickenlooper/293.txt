Gov. John Hickenlooper issued this statement tonight about Amendment 66.

"As Coloradans, we have a history of going after what we believe is the best, right thing, based upon facts, and we go after that goal with hard work and heart. That's the Western spirit alive in each of us.

"For some people Amendment 66 was only about taxes. For others it was about investing in and sacrificing for our most valuable resource: our children. We are committed to common sense solutions and remain committed to collaborating with everyone to make Colorado's education system the best it can be."
