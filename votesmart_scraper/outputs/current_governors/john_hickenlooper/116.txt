Date: July 13, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement in support of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announcement of a final rule that furthers fair housing.
HUD's rule equips communities that receive HUD funding with data and tools to help them meet long-standing fair housing obligations in their use of HUD funds. HUD will also provide additional guidance and technical assistance to facilitate local decision-making on fair housing priorities and goals for affordable housing and community development.
"The announcement by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to enhance fair housing rules provides much needed clarification and tools to those communities who receive HUD funding, including those in Colorado. Moving forward with clear and concise guidelines will help reduce barriers and assist communities in providing safe, affordable housing for everyone."
