Gov. John Hickenlooper tonight released the following statement about President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:

""Opportunity is who we are.' Those words from President Obama tonight hit the mark. Our country is defined by opportunity, by our immigrants and our new ideas, and by the pursuit of more jobs in a growing economy. The President's call for more high-tech manufacturing, energy independence and greater access to world-class education also resonate well in the West. We share the president's belief that when women succeed, the country--Colorado--succeeds. We join the President's optimism that through bipartisan action, and by keeping our focus on tomorrow, our country can continue moving forward."
