Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement regarding the news that Colorado's unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 percent in August from 5.3 percent in July 2014. The national unemployment rate is 6.1 percent.
"This latest drop in our state's unemployment rate - to the lowest it has been since September 2008 - is tremendous news for Coloradans. It is further evidence that Colorado's economy is growing across sectors and another example of why "Business Insider" recently ranked Colorado's economy the fastest growing in the country. In Colorado, we work together and make our own luck, and we will not rest until the momentum of our robust overall economy reaches every community throughout the state. You work hard Colorado; enjoy the weekend."
The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment released the monthly report today, showing Colorado's total employment (2,659,800) series has reached a new, historic peak. The last time the Colorado unemployment rate was as low as 5.1 percent was September 2008 when it was also 5.1 percent. In August 2013 the Colorado unemployment rate was 6.8 percent.
