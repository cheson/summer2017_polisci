Gov. John Hickenlooper joined Reggie Bicha, executive director of the Colorado Department of Human Services, lawmakers and child advocates today to recognize April as Child Abuse Prevention month, and to discuss Colorado's first statewide child abuse and neglect hotline -- 1-844-CO-4-KIDS. Colorado's new child abuse and neglect hotline began operating on Jan. 1, 2015, and has already received 54,381 calls from concerned citizens, resulting in 8,196 screened-in reports of child abuse and neglect.

The statewide hotline is the result of the governor's child welfare plan "Keeping Kids Safe and Families Healthy." The hotline serves as a direct, immediate and efficient route to Colorado's 64 counties and two tribal nations, which are responsible for accepting and responding to child abuse and neglect inquiries and reports. All callers speak with a call-taker 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

"Children are undeniably Colorado's most precious resource," said Hickenlooper. "It is our responsibility to do everything we can to protect our children and ensure their safety."

"Everyone in our state plays a vital role in the prevention of child abuse and neglect, and we need to spread that message," said Bicha. "Thanks to the hotline, it's easier than ever to pick up the phone and make a call if you see something that concerns you. You dial the number, we'll make the call."
