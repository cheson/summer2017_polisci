Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper and Josh Reeves, CEO and co-founder of ZenPayroll announced today that the company has expanded its business and opened a new office in Denver, Colorado with plans to hire more than 100 full-time employees immediately and 1,000 people in the next few years.
As part of ZenPayroll's extensive search to find a city that supports its rapid growth, Denver became the clear choice because of the city's quality of life, innovative culture, ideal economic environment, and wealth of top talent. Having announced support for businesses nationwide earlier this year, ZenPayroll will use its new central location to better meet their customer needs.
"Denver is a vibrant, growing city where we are excited to expand our footprint, hire kindred spirits, and better serve our customers across the country," said Reeves. "We are also eager to get involved locally as an active, responsible member of the Denver community."
The announcement comes fresh off a $60 million round of funding led by Google Capital and with participation from Emergence Capital Partners, Ribbit Capital, Thiel Capital, and others, as well as existing investors including General Catalyst, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Google Ventures.
"ZenPayroll's expansion adds to the growing list of innovative technology companies that have chosen to make a significant investment in Colorado," said Hickenlooper. "We are confident that our state's business-friendly environment will provide ZenPayroll with the support that the company needs to excel. We look forward to tracking the company's growth over the next few years and seeing its positive impact on our economy."
ZenPayroll launched in 2012 and currently processes billions of dollars in annual payroll for tens of thousands of small businesses across the country. ZenPayroll's second location in Denver will be the main hub for its customer service teams, which are focused on providing memorable, delightful experiences to prospects and customers. The new office will be in the heart of downtown Denver near Union Station.
"We're thrilled that ZenPayroll decided to expand its operations into Denver," said Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. "We're grateful for their confidence and investment in our great city, and we're delighted to welcome them to our ever-expanding roster of fast-growth companies that are creating jobs, expanding our economy, and helping make ours a city of opportunity for all."
