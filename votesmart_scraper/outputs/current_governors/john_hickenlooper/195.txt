"We are excited by the proposal from the state of Colorado, the County of Montrose, and the City of Montrose. Each group has been great to work with," said David Dragoo, president of Mayfly Outdoors.
Outside of Colorado, the company had also considered competitive opportunities in Arizona, Texas and Utah.
In partnership with the Montrose Economic Development Corporation and the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, the Economic Development Commission (EDC) deployed a strategic fund performance-based incentive of $280,000 to support the creation of 56 new full-time jobs that pay 130 percent of Montrose County's average annual wage, and the expansion of Mayfly Outdoors.
