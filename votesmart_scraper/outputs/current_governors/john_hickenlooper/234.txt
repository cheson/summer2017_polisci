It was a big day for vets graduating from the United Association of Veterans in Piping.
Wednesday, Governor John Hickenlooper congratulated 14 men on completing an 18 week program toward a career in piping and welding.
"These returning vets, obviously they volunteered to put their lives on the line for our country. They've got character," said Hickenlooper.
According to Hickenlooper, these men are now getting their shot at the American dream.
"That character and that experience demonstrates that they're going to be great employees," Hickenlooper said.
Hickenlooper said he believes being in the military, plus having a valuable skills makes these veterans more marketable.
"They've been trained in probably the best training process on earth, in terms of how you collaborate, work together with a bunch of very different people, which is a skill in high demand in the modern world," Hickenlooper said. "99.5% of these vets are going to become stellar leaders in the workplace, whether they're driving a truck, whether they're working, doing pipefitting, whatever jobs they find themselves in. I think they're going to add value to any company."
As for SSG William Mikschl, he's looking forward to demonstrating just that and making that transition from the military to the workplace.
"It's got to be one of the best things you can do. It gives you an opportunity to still be in the military, but experience a civilian life, you know working a job and not doing PT, growing a little bit of a beard," said Mikschl.
SSG Mikschl said he's going to start a four year apprenticeship program and then begin his career as a welder.
