Gov. John Hickenlooper, in partnership with the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS), today announced the launch of Colorado's first-ever statewide mental health crisis hotline.

Mental health professionals are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at 844-493-TALK (8255) to provide solutions and support to Coloradans in crisis.

"We do not want to lose one more person to the tragedy of suicide, gun violence, substance abuse or mental illness," Hickenlooper said. "Colorado made an unwavering commitment to redesign and strengthen our mental health service support system and this is a critical step. The statewide hotline increases access to care for anyone in need and will help safeguard our residents, our families and our communities."

The mental health crisis hotline represents a significant component of the Administration's initiative "Strengthening Colorado's Mental Health System: A Plan to Safeguard All Coloradans." The Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) is partnering with Metro Crisis Services to operate the hotline.

Callers to the Colorado Crisis and Support Line will be connected with experienced professionals, counselors, and peer specialists who are trained to:

-Assess and plan for safety;
-Provide solutions and support to persons or their loved ones who are experiencing a mental health or substance abuse issue; and,
-Make referrals to resources, as needed.
