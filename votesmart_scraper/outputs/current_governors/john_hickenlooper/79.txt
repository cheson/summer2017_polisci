Gov. John Hickenlooper released the following statement today regarding the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) proposal aimed at reducing waste and harmful emissions from oil and gas operations.
"Two years ago, Colorado passed some of the most robust emissions requirements across the country for oil and gas operations, including the nation's first methane regulations. We're pleased to see that elements of the BLM's proposed regulations on flaring, venting and leak prevention are modeled from Colorado's rules, and will minimize the waste of natural gas while reducing harmful emissions."
"We will take a close look at the proposed rules and work with stakeholders to provide feedback to the BLM, in an effort to ensure that the final rules take into account the work that Colorado has already done and maintain an effective and efficient regulatory environment for oil and gas operations across the state."
