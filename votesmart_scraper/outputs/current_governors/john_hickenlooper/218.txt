Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement regarding the news that Colorado's unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in July from 5.5 percent in June 2014.
"Colorado's unemployment rate is the lowest in almost six years and gives us a solid foundation to continue to build the state's future. While our economy continues to be recognized as the fastest growing in the nation, we know there is still much work to be done. We are focused on ensuring we foster a positive business climate -- whether a start-up or Fortune 500 company -- and retaining our talented workforce. We will continue to work together, work smart and work strategically until we see economic success in every corner of the state."
In July 2014, the U.S. unemployment rate increased one tenth of a percentage point to 6.2 percent. The last time the Colorado unemployment rate was as low as 5.3 percent was October 2008. Colorado added 5,500 nonfarm payroll jobs from June to July, making this the 33rd consecutive month of payroll jobs gains, and jobs grew 2.7 percent over the year.
