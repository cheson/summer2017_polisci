Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper joined Pinnacol Assurance in agreeing today to slow down a proposed restructuring of the company and delay any action during the current legislative session.
"We agree with Pinnacol that additional time is needed to fully explore the proposal," Hickenlooper said. "Clearly, there is more work to do. We look forward to continuing the conversations about restructuring in the coming weeks and months. Our priority remains doing what's best for injured workers, policyholders and the people of Colorado."
