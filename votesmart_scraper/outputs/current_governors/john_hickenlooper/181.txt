Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement regarding the U.S. Housing and Urban Development report that the total number of persons experiencing homelessness in Colorado is down 35.2 percent since 2010:
"Of all of the promising trends that have occurred in Colorado during the last four years, today's report showing the significant drop in homelessness is some of the very best news yet. Because there is no single answer to ending homelessness, we have been addressing it from many angles. We've focused on increasing affordable housing with an investment of $41 million from the mortgage settlement, while also increasing the General Fund allocated to creating more affordable housing from $2 million in 2010 to the current $8.2 million. Because of these investments, we have created 1,900 beds/units for the homeless across the state over the last four years, including 200 new beds at Fort Lyon, where many of the residents are veterans. To see an overall decrease in homelessness of 35.2 percent with a 33 percent drop in homelessness among our veterans, this is truly wonderful news."
