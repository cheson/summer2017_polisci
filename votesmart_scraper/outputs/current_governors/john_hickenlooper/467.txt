Gov. John Hickenlooper announced today an agreement has been reached between the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and plaintiffs regarding litigation arising from the 2004 implementation of the Colorado Benefits Management System, or CBMS.
CBMS determines eligibility for the State's medical and financial assistance programs.
"The Colorado Benefits Management System must be functional and accurate," Hickenlooper said.
"We are actively working with various state agencies involved with CBMS to find real solutions that will benefit the thousands of people who depend on the computer system for state benefits. The agreement signed today reflects our commitment to work with counties to provide these benefits to the state's most vulnerable residents in a timely manner."
In August 2010, advocate attorneys filed a motion for contempt alleging that the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing had failed to comply with the terms of a 2007 settlement agreement. The newly amended settlement agreement requires the Department to improve the timeliness of initial application processing over different periods and reach a 95 percent compliance rate by June 30, 2013.
The Department is also required to meet benchmarks for the timely processing of redeterminations.
Over the last several years, the State has experienced an unprecedented growth in the number of people applying for benefits as a result of the economic recession. This new agreement allows for a gradual improvement of performance over a predetermined period in recognition of the increased demands for benefits.
