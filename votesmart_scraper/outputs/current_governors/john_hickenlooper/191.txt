Governor John Hickenlooper today issued the following statement regarding the state's Ebola virus preparedness plan:
"While there are no Ebola cases in Colorado, we have prepared and will continue to prepare for the possibility of a case. Among the many steps we've taken, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has activated our statewide network of health care agencies, providers and hospitals to ensure they have the information and resources needed to spot and stop the virus, as well as keep our health care workers safe. We assembled a 24-7 mobilization team of medical and infectious disease experts prepared to respond immediately to isolate, manage and treat any possible cases, and we've convened the Governor's Expert Emergency Epidemic Response Committee to keep real-time oversight and coordination of the virus and response. While the news of Ebola continues to evolve, Colorado will remain ready."
