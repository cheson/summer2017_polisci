Colorado voters who once supported Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper now plan to cast their ballots for his Republican challenger, citing the incumbent's support for the toughest gun laws in a decade and a reprieve from execution he granted to a convicted killer on death row.
Polls show Hickenlooper, the former Denver mayor and geologist once considered America's most popular governor, is in a statistical dead heat against Bob Beauprez, a bison rancher and former congressman who lost a 2006 run for the state's highest office by 16 percentage points. Beauprez is leading Hickenlooper by less than 1 point, according to an average of polls by RealClearPolitics.com.
The tight race reflects a divide between rural residents angered by new regulations and city dwellers in Denver and Boulder. Hickenlooper presided over laws requiring background checks for gun purchases, limiting the size of ammunition magazines and imposing renewable energy mandates.
"I saw a guy I thought matched up with the way I looked at the world who failed to stop a runaway legislature," said Dave Maney, 51, chief executive officer of Deke Digital LLC, a Wheat Ridge-based digital marketing services firm.
"Personal Freedoms'
"He went from being happy to drink fracking fluid to somehow being willing to brook this giant discussion on drilling near communities," said Maney, a registered unaffiliated voter who donated to Hickenlooper's 2010 campaign but plans to cast his ballot for Beauprez. "Then he moved to restrict peoples' personal freedoms with guns."
