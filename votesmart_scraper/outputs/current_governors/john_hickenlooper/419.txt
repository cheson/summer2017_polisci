Gov. John Hickenlooper and Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia today released these statements about Colorado receiving a waiver from the No Child Left Behind program:

"Colorado's education reform initiatives go beyond what was required by No Child Left Behind," Hickenlooper said. "We are working to help ensure every student receives an excellent education, is prepared for post-secondary education and is workforce-ready. We are also fortunate to have Lt. Gov. Garcia spearheading Colorado's education reform. Through his leadership and collaborative efforts, Colorado is realizing real progress with its students and gaining much-deserved national recognition."

"This waiver from the federal government affirms Colorado's position as a national leader for promoting school and student accountability to help ensure the best educational outcomes for kids," Garcia said. "The Department of Education, under the State Board's leadership, is showing its commitment to good governance by helping to create a more effective system of accountability and streamline reporting requirements for school districts."
