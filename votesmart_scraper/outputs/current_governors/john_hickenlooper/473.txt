Gov. John Hickenlooper attended a luncheon today for the My Colorado student contest winners and signed an executive order to create the Governor's Education Leadership Council.
"Our state's future is only as strong as our students and their ability to gain a world-class education," Hickenlooper said. "By establishing this leadership council, we are building on past successful initiatives and ensuring a skilled workforce to compete in a global economy."
The Governor's Education Leadership Council will be housed in the Office of the Lieutenant Governor and will replace the previous Governor's P-20 Educating Coordinating Council.
"Under Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia's leadership," Hickenlooper said, "we will help current students and future generations find the best education, regardless of geographic location, social or economic background."
