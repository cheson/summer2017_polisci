Press Release

Location: Denver, CO

Governor John Hickenlooper today issued this statement following the announcement from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment that Colorado's unemployment rate dropped to 4.7 percent in September from 5.1 percent last month, and down from 6.6 percent in September 2013. The national unemployment rate is 5.9 percent.
"The fact that Colorado has now had 35 consecutive months of payroll job gains; the fact that in the last four years Colorado's unemployment rate has dropped from 9.1 percent to 4.7 percent--the lowest the unemployment rate has been since the pre-Great Recession summer of 2008--this is a testament to the resilience, the work ethic, and to the innovative spirit of Coloradans all across this incredible state. But as far as this office is concerned, now is not the time to become complacent or take anything for granted. Now is the time to keep at it, to seize momentum. We will not rest until every community in Colorado is feeling the benefits of this robust economic growth. And we do so knowing that if we can get here--despite the challenges we have faced together--indeed, we can and we will get there, together. In Colorado, we make our own luck-- together."
The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment released the monthly report today, showing Colorado's total employment (2,671,200) and payroll jobs (2,464,500) series both reached new, historic peaks in September. The last time the Colorado unemployment rate was as low as 4.7 percent was June 2008 when it was also 4.7 percent.
