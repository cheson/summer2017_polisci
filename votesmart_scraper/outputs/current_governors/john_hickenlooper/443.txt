Location: Denver, CO

An estimated 35,000 people attended the "Colorado Remembers 9/11" memorial event Sunday afternoon in Denver's Civic Center Park.
The event, hosted by Gov. John Hickenlooper and Mayor Michael Hancock, started with a procession of more than 500 Colorado National Guardsmen and first responders from across the state. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, U.S. Sens. Mark Udall and Michael Bennet and other Colorado dignitaries then honored those who died on Sept. 11, 2001. Full military honors, including a fly over, a 21-gun salute and Taps closed the memorial service.
The event included a tribute concert to celebrate service men and women, public safety officers and America's will to prevail.
"This ceremony was more than just a remembrance of the past and a tribute to those who died 10 years ago," Hickenlooper said. "It was also a chance for all of Colorado to come together to honor the men and women who continue to protect our country and to celebrate the freedoms we have."
"We were extremely honored to play a key role in presenting this event to the people of Denver and Colorado," Hancock said. "It's as important as ever that we stop and reflect on the lives that were lost and the heroes that stepped up as a result of this tragic event 10 years ago. Americans are an enduring people who recognize that in order to move forward, we must never forget."
"Colorado Remembers 9/11" was presented by The Counterterrorism Education Learning Lab (The CELL) and The Denver Post, 9News and AEGLive Rocky Mountains.
