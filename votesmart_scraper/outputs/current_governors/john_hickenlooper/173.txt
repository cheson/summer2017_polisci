Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on Recent Unemployment Numbers
Statement

Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today issued this statement following the announcement from the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment that Colorado's unemployment rate dropped to 4.3 percent in October from 6.5 percent in October 2013. The national unemployment rate is 5.8 percent.

"The jobs numbers out today show how far Colorado has come in just the last four years," Hickenlooper said. "Only four years ago, the unemployment rate was 9.1 percent; it's now 4.3 percent, and we're now into our 36th consecutive month of payroll job gains. This robust economic growth is a testament to the efforts taken by hard-working, innovative Coloradans. While we're pleased to see these results, we know there are people out there looking for work, trying to realize their dreams, and we remain focused on them. We will not rest until the economic recovery is felt in every community throughout our state."

The last time the Colorado unemployment rate was as low as 4.3 percent was March 2008, two months prior to pre-recession jobs peak reached in May 2008.
