Fort Carson soldiers of all jobs and training backgrounds are getting a chance to engineer a new future using skills from their military service.
Wednesday, 13 soldiers graduated from the Veterans In Piping program. The program's goal is to ensure the soldiers - most of whom are in the process of transitioning out of the military - have a job waiting for them.

Governor John Hickenlooper also attended the event and encouraged the soldiers to forge ahead with their new professions.
"Once you've been through the military in this country, no one is going to doubt your work ethic. No one is going to doubt your character," he said. "Your experience creates a set of skills that are going to translate into making you great employees."
