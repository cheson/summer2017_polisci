Gov. John Hickenlooper and Kevin Patterson, interim executive director of the Colorado Department of Local Affairs (DOLA), today announced $34,240,176 in competitive grants has been awarded to 40 projects throughout Colorado through the Energy and Mineral Impact Assistance Fund grant program. Projects address key public improvements ranging from public facilities to water and wastewater systems in communities statewide.

"This grant program continues to be invaluable to Colorado's smaller and rural communities," said Hickenlooper. "With these funds, communities are able to plan for and implement substantial capital improvements, essential public projects and other services."

DOLA administers the grant program, which assists political subdivisions that are socially and/or economically impacted by the development, processing, or energy conversion of minerals and mineral fuels. Funds come from the state severance tax on energy and mineral production and from a portion of the state's share of royalties paid to the federal government for mining and drilling of minerals and mineral fuels on federally-owned land. The program was created by the legislature in 1977.

Types of projects funded by the program include construction of or improvements to water and sewer systems, roads, recreation centers, public safety and other public facilities, fire protection buildings and equipment, and local government planning.

"These dollars strengthen communities and are made possible through well-established partnerships between all levels of government and the energy industry. DOLA takes great pride in being a steward of these funds," Patterson said.
