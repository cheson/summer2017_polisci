Gov. Hickenlooper to Write Memoir; Maximillian Potter Departs Senior Staff to Co-Author Book
Press Release
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: May 28, 2015
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced that senior media adviser and speechwriter Maximillian Potter will depart the governor's senior staff to co-author Hickenlooper's memoir, effective June 5, 2015.
"I'm told the traits of a great speechwriter are idealism, intelligence, and empathy," said Hickenlooper. "Max is one of those great speechwriters. He also has a knack for quickly sizing up a situation and he's not afraid to speak his mind, which is what makes him an invaluable adviser. While Max is leaving staff to work on the memoir, my hope is he will continue to be a resource for the administration and this state as we continue to write the story of Colorado."
Hickenlooper's memoir, "The Opposite of Woe: My Life in Beer and Politics," will be published in May 2016 by The Penguin Press.
"A little over two years ago, when Governor Hickenlooper first talked with me about joining his administration, he said the goal of my job wouldn't be all that different than the goal of my life as a journalist: communicating in order to make the state a better place," Potter said. "Working with the governor and his team in pursuit of this goal, and along the way witnessing the everyday awesomeness of Coloradans has been a remarkable and inspiring experience that I will treasure. My hope is that we will capture that Colorado spirit in the governor's memoir."
Kristen O'Neill, who oversees digital content strategy for the governor's office, will take on the additional duties of speechwriting.
