The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published clarifying guidance this week in the Federal Register. This guidance is designed to eliminate obstacles and provide a greater degree of flexibility in the State of Colorado's delivery of disaster assistance resources through its ongoing Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding activities.
The State, in collaboration with local government partners and its Congressional delegation, advocated for these clarifications.
"While these revisions have a positive national impact, locally they allow us to more efficiently and effectively respond to a greater number of Coloradans who were impacted by the floods," said Gov. John Hickenlooper. "We will be better able to support them as they rebuild their lives and their livelihoods."
