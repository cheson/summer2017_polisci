Gov. Hickenlooper's Statement on EPA Freeze
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: Jan. 24, 2017
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today released the following statement:
"We received notice today that the team from the new administration asked the EPA to temporarily suspend grant and contract awards. The communication was ambiguous and did not explain the duration or scope of the freeze. This freeze could potentially impact the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's ability to carry out its federally mandated commitment to protect clean air, clean water and safe drinking water. We have sought clarification from the EPA and have asked for assistance from Senators Gardner and Bennet."
