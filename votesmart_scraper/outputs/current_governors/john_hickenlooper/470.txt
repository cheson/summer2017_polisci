Gov. John Hickenlooper tonight released the following statement about President Barack Obama's State of the Union address:
"If there was one word that stood out in the President's speech tonight it was innovation. His emphasis on reform, responsibility and support for education was right on target. The President sounded themes that should resonate with Coloradans no matter what their political affiliation may be, including a call to make government more efficient, cutting red tape and unleashing the country's entrepreneurial spirit.
It was also encouraging to hear the President commend a Colorado school that embraced reform and created opportunity for its students. This kind of change isn't Democrat or Republican, it's change sparked by all communities coming together. We need more of that for the benefit of our Colorado and our nation."
