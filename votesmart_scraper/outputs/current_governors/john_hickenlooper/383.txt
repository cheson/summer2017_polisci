Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed two bills to help military families in Colorado. The bills will allow military spouses to transfer professional licenses and military children to obtain education at in-state tuition costs.

"We can't have a strong military without having strong military families," Hickenlooper said. "By expanding job opportunities to military spouses and increasing access to education, we are working to make Colorado the most military-friendly state in the nation."

Hickenlooper signed HB12-1059, "Military Spouse Practice Occupation Profession," sponsored by Rep. Marsha Looper and Sen. Mary Hodge. The bill allows military spouses to use their out-of-state professional licenses in Colorado for one year.

He also signed HB12-1350, "In-state Status Dependents Armed Forces Members," sponsored by Rep. Mark Waller and Sen. Mary Hodge. The bill allows public colleges and universities to provide in-state tuition to the children of active military.
