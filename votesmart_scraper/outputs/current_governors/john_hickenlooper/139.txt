Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed a proclamation recognizing May as Mental Health Awareness Month in an event that also highlighted the achievements of Colorado Crisis Services, a statewide mental health resource.
Colorado Crisis Services is a program with a $25 million annual budget started in 2014 to address mental health issues in the community through round-the-clock stabilization centers, a mobile unit, a crisis hotline and respite services.
The event, hosted by the Colorado Department of Human Services and Mental Health America of Colorado, was held at the Santa Fe House, Littleton's walk-in crisis center.
"The month of May calls attention to the importance of addressing mental health symptoms early and planning appropriate action that takes overall health into account," Hickenlooper said. "Colorado Crisis Services was developed as a statewide initiative strengthening our state's mental health system and safeguarding all Coloradans."
Colorado Crisis Services provides confidential and immediate professional help for any mental health, substance use, or emotional concern, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Those in need may access trained, professional specialists and peer counselors, mobile units, respite care, crisis walk-in centers and stabilization units that are available throughout the state. Since services began in December of 2014, 5,363 individuals have been seen at walk-in stabilization units, and 6,057 individuals have been served by mobile units.
In addition, Colorado Crisis Services in August launched a statewide mental health crisis line to provide Coloradans access to mental health professionals for 24-hour crisis support at 844-493-TALK (8255). Since the hotline began, it has received more than 50,000 calls.
