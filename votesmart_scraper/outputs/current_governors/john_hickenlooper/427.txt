Statement

Gov. John Hickenlooper released this statement today about the Lobato v. Colorado court case:
"It is clear after closely reviewing the judge's decision in Lobato v. Colorado and consulting with Attorney General John Suthers that a final resolution of the constitutional and legal issues involved in the case require an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court.
"The judge's decision provided little practical guidance on how the state should fund a "thorough and uniform' system of public education. Moreover, while the judge focused on the inadequacy of state funding, she did not reconcile this issue with other very relevant provisions of the Constitution, including the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, the Gallagher Amendment and Amendment 23.
"There are more appropriate venues for a vigorous and informed public debate about the state's spending priorities. We look forward to a swift decision in this case so the people of Colorado and their elected representatives can participate in the school funding conversation."
