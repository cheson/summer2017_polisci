Gov. John Hickenlooper and the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) today announced the first round of grantees of the Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant Program. A total of $2,908,883 was awarded for both Proof-of-Concept and Early Stage Capital and Retention Grants to support key industries.

Advanced industries are prime drivers of the United States and Colorado economy, comprised of engineering and R&D intensive companies that deliver products and services in industries ranging from aerospace to medical devices. Colorado's advanced industry strategy was developed as part of the Colorado Blueprint launched in 2011.

"The growth in advanced industries in Colorado is adding jobs and having statewide impact on our economy," Hickenlooper said. "Today's grant announcement demonstrates the state's continued support of innovation and growth in these sectors."

Proof-of-Concept grants are open to Colorado research universities, federal labs located in Colorado and other private, nonprofit and for-profit labs with valid technology transfer offices. Proof-of-Concept Grants are for Pre-Commercialization Research and Commercialization Preparation.
