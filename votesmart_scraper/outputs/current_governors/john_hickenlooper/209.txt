Gov. John Hickenlooper today announced the members of the task force that will address land use issues and the role of state and local government in siting oil and gas facilities.

"Critical to the success and effectiveness of this task force is ensuring there is balanced and informed representation," said Gov. Hickenlooper. "We are confident that the task force members we have assembled to take on these critically important issues for our state are exactly the right group to ensure that Colorado's economy and environment remain healthy and robust. We are grateful to all of these board members for their willingness to work together to help find the right solution for Colorado. And we are grateful to the many applicants who submitted their names for consideration."
