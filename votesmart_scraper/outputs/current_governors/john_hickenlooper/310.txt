Gov. Hickenlooper Statement About Recall Elections
Statement
By: John Hickenlooper
Date: Sept. 9, 2013
Location: Denver, CO

Gov. John Hickenlooper issued this statement today about the recall elections in El Paso and Pueblo counties:

"We are hearing disturbing reports that some people are being encouraged to go to the polls, not to legitimately vote, but to disrupt the process. That would be unlawful and makes a mockery of the democratic process.

"We urge the county clerks in Pueblo and El Paso counties to make clear that people engaged in attempting to disrupt the elections are open to criminal prosecution. We've also reached out to the Attorney General to help us ensure fair elections take place this week."
