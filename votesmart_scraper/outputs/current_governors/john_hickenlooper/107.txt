The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today proposed standards to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), notably methane, and volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the oil and natural gas operations.
This move follows Colorado's 2014 rules as the first state in the nation to directly regulate methane which was embraced by the Oil and Gas Task Force and passed by the General Assembly in 2015.
While the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment is still in the process of reviewing the EPA's proposed rule, they anticipate it will complement and not interfere with steps Colorado has already taken in striking a balance between the state's need for a healthy oil and gas industry and resident concern about health, safety and the environment.
The state will work closely with industry stakeholders and the EPA in the reviewing the details and providing feedback specific to Colorado.
"Colorado is a model demonstrating the success that can come from collaboration and hard work," said Hickenlooper. "As a result of tough discussions between industry leaders, the environmental community, and other relevant stakeholders, we became the first state in the country over a year ago to directly regulate methane emissions. In Colorado, protecting public health and the environment, and promoting our energy industry are not mutually exclusive endeavors.
