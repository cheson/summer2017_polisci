A few years ago, Gov. John Hickenlooper told Colorado investors such as Jim Kelley that they ought to do more to help local entrepreneurs.
The state has talent, the governor said, but businesses need better access to money and mentors.
Kelley, co-founder of Vestar Capital Partners, took the challenge to heart and began researching the issue. And soon, he said, he agreed with Hickenlooper.
At an event with Hickenlooper at the governor's mansion Tuesday evening, Kelley and Ryan Heckman of Excellere Partners officially launched the private Colorado Impact Fund, an investment group that aims to fix the problem -- and turn a profit.
"From an investor's point of view, we do business all across the country, all across the globe for that matter," Kelley said in an interview. "We're not always as focused as we should be on, 'How can we contribute to the community we live in?' "
The fund has $62 million to invest, all from a group of about 20 Colorado investors, Kelley said.
Colorado Impact Fund, which will also pair businesses with mentors and advisers, is likely to invest in 10 to 15 companies in the next five years. It plans to announce its first investment in the next few months.
