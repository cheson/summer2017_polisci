Gov. John Hickenlooper and Lt. Gov. Joe Garcia today released these statements about the latest Race to the Top -- Early Learning Challenge grant announcement:

"The state's Race to the Top application was developed through a collaborative process that brought together the state's smartest child advocates," Hickenlooper said. "This extensive planning helped create a clear roadmap for pursuing the best educational outcomes for our state's kids. Colorado is a national leader when it comes to education reform and we remain committed to supporting our teachers and students in every way possible."

"Colorado has seen so much progress already in the quality of early learning programs that help ensure every child starts school ready to learn," Garcia said. "We will continue to build on the solid foundation already set for creating a stronger workforce, providing families with the tools and resources they need and to building community capacity to serve young children and their families."

Colorado applied for $59.8 million in Race to the Top funds to help accelerate plans to improve school readiness by strengthening the quality of all early learning programs, increasing access to high-quality programs and developing the capacity of those people, places and programs serving children with the highest needs.

In a separate Race to the Top application focused on the K-12 system, Colorado is one of nine finalists to apply for a $17.9 million grant by updating the state's last application submitted in June 2010. The U.S. Dept. of Education will announce these grant recipients by the end of this month.
