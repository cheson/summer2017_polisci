Gov. John Hickenlooper today signed 29 bills, including one that refocuses the Colorado Energy Office to build on the state's national reputation as a leader in clean energy and energy innovation and to enhance the office's ability to support private-sector job creation in renewable energy and natural gas industries.

"This legislation helps ensure our continued investment and research in Colorado's energy industry," Hickenlooper said about HB12-1315. "The office will promote clean and affordable sources of energy that are critical to the future of our state."

The energy office bill changed the name of the office to the Colorado Energy Office, secured funding for five years and established the office's Innovative Energy Fund and the Clean & Renewable Energy Fund.

The Colorado Energy Office promotes sustainable economic development in Colorado by encouraging job creation, increasing energy security and lowering long-term consumer costs while protecting the environment.
