Public safety is a priority for every Coloradan. We can be tough on crime while also smart about spending taxpayer money. And we should expect results.
Key Priorities
* Review existing incarceration policies and better coordinate with human services.
* Put evidence-based actions into place and review how federal resources are allocated statewide to support effective law enforcement.
* Continue to build on and improve transparency and communication, connecting all local jurisdictions across the State.
"As a brewpub owner in what was once a tough neighborhood and much later as mayor of Denver, I know how important it is for people to feel safe in their communities. There is no bigger priority in government than maintaining public safety." -- John Hickenlooper
Background
The State of Colorado continues to face budget shortfalls. Continuing to approach public safety with a business-as-usual mindset is a poor use of increasingly limited taxpayer dollars. To improve public safety, we must find and implement proven alternatives that are both cost-effective and measurable.
For starters, violent offenders and others who pose an ongoing danger to the health and property of Coloradans should be in prison. This is the only alternative worth considering for this population. However, that is only one part (and, thankfully, a small part) of a larger criminal justice strategy. Colorado taxpayers invest millions of dollars in public safety. We should measure our results and aim to reach a higher standard of success.
